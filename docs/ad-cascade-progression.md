# AD Linguistic Cascade — Semantic to Pragmatic Progression

## The Cascade Model

Alzheimer's Disease affects language in a predictable cascade pattern. Understanding this cascade is critical for early detection and differential diagnosis.

### Stage 0: Pre-Symptomatic (Tau Accumulation)
**Onset: Years before clinical symptoms**
- Subtle fluency changes detectable only through longitudinal monitoring
- Increased pause duration at very low levels (0.1-0.2s increase)
- No vocabulary or memory changes yet
- Reference: Young et al. 2024 — pre-symptomatic tau correlates with fluency microchanges
- **MemoVoice Detection**: Only possible with >14 session baseline and sensitive thresholds

### Stage 1: Semantic Memory Involvement
**Onset: 12-24 months before diagnosis**
- **Lexical**: TTR drops, word-finding pauses, generic substitutions ("the thing" for "scissors")
- **Coherence**: Topic drift begins, idea density drops
- **Preserved**: Syntax still intact, fluency only mildly affected
- This is the **MOST CRITICAL** detection window
- Reference: Fraser 2015, Eyigoz Framingham Study
- **MemoVoice Detection**: L1_ttr + C1_idea_density co-decline triggers YELLOW

### Stage 2: Syntactic Simplification
**Onset: 6-18 months before diagnosis**
- MLU decreases significantly
- Subordination index drops (fewer embedded clauses)
- Sentence fragments increase
- But basic grammar still correct (vs Broca's aphasia)
- Reference: Fraser 2015 Factor 2, Mueller 2018
- **MemoVoice Detection**: S1_mlu + S2_subordination decline on top of Stage 1 signals

### Stage 3: Discourse Coherence Collapse
**Onset: Around time of clinical diagnosis**
- Multiple domains now affected
- Topic maintenance severely impaired
- Referential coherence breaks down
- Temporal sequencing disrupted
- Fluency deteriorates (long pauses, fillers, false starts)
- Reference: Fraser 2015 Stage 3-4
- **MemoVoice Detection**: C2 + C3 + F1 all declining → ORANGE/RED

### Stage 4: Pragmatic Failure
**Onset: Post-diagnosis, progressive**
- Communication breakdown
- Turn-taking difficulties
- Inappropriate responses
- Conversation flow severely disrupted
- Beyond MemoVoice screening scope — requires clinical management

## Differential Patterns

### Normal Aging (NO cascade)
- All domains: stable or very slight parallel decline
- No sequential domain progression
- Self-correction preserved
- Month-to-month variance is NOISE, not SIGNAL

### Depression (NOT a cascade)
- All domains simultaneously suppressed
- Episodic pattern (bad days/weeks, then recovery)
- Coherence PRESERVED
- Cued recall responsive (unlike AD)

### Parkinson's (Fluency-dominant)
- Fluency significantly affected (motor speech)
- Lexical richness PRESERVED
- No semantic-to-syntactic cascade
- Hypophonia and articulation issues

### Medication Effects (Acute, all-at-once)
- All domains drop simultaneously at change date
- Recovery expected within 1-3 weeks
- No progressive cascade pattern
- Temporal correlation with prescription changes

## Clinical Implications
- Early detection depends on catching Stage 1 (semantic involvement)
- By Stage 3, conventional clinical diagnosis is typically made
- MemoVoice aims to detect at Stage 0-1, giving 12-24 months lead time
- Cascade order is the strongest differential signal vs depression/medication
