Simple Summary
Mammals communicate with one another using many different signals, such as facial
expressions, body posture, sounds, touch, and smells. These signals help them express
emotions, avoid conflicts, build relationships, and function safely in social groups. Animals
that live closely with humans, such as dogs, cats, horses, goats, and farm animals, have
adapted their natural ways of communicating to interact more effectively with people.
Domestication has changed how these species use their voice, eyes, body, and behaviour,
making some signals clearer and easier for humans to understand. At the same time,
modern farming systems can limit the natural exchange of signals and make it harder to
recognise signs of stress or discomfort. This review explains how mammals communicate
across different senses, how emotions shape their behaviour, and how human influence has
changed these processes. It also shows how new technologies, such as continuous video
and sound monitoring, can help detect pain, stress, or illness early, improving the care and
welfare of animals. Understanding how animals send and receive signals allows people to
respond more accurately to their needs, strengthens relationships with domestic species,
and creates safer, kinder, and more ethical environments.
Abstract
Communication in mammals constitutes a complex, multimodal system that integrates
visual, acoustic, tactile, and chemical signals whose functions extend beyond simple infor-
mation transfer to include the regulation of social relationships, coordination of behaviour,
and expression of emotional states. This article examines the fundamental mechanisms
of communication from biological, neuroethological, and behavioural perspectives, with
particular emphasis on domesticated and farmed species. Analysis of sensory signals
demonstrates that their perception and interpretation are closely linked to the physiology
of sensory organs as well as to social experience and environmental context. In companion
animals such as dogs and cats, domestication has significantly modified communicative
repertoires ranging from the development of specialised facial musculature in dogs to
adaptive diversification of vocalisations in cats. The neurobiological foundations of com-
munication, including the activity of the amygdala, limbic structures, and mirror-neuron
systems, provide evidence for homologous mechanisms of emotion recognition across
species. The article also highlights the role of communication in shaping social structures

and the influence of husbandry conditions on the behaviour of farm animals. In inten-
sive production environments, acoustic, visual, and chemical signals are often shaped or
distorted by crowding, noise, and chronic stress, with direct consequences for welfare. Fur-
thermore, the growing importance of multimodal technologies such as Precision Livestock
Farming (PLF) and Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI) is discussed, particularly their role
in enabling objective monitoring of emotional states and behaviour and supporting individ-
ualised care. Overall, the analysis underscores that communication forms the foundation
of social functioning in mammals, and that understanding this complexity is essential
for ethology, animal welfare, training practices, and the design of modern technologies
facilitating human–animal interaction.

1. Introduction
Communication is understood as the process of transmitting information from a
sender to a receiver. Humans have developed highly complex systems and tools that
enable rapid and precise exchange of diverse content, including over long distances and
without direct physical interaction. A central component of this capacity is advanced verbal
communication, grounded in spoken language. In the animal world, however, verbal
communication occurs only in rudimentary forms and in a limited number of species.
Among non-human animals, communication involves the transmission of signals between
individuals of the same or different species. While some signals are produced intention-
ally to elicit specific behavioural responses, communication more broadly encompasses
the transfer of information about an individual’s emotional or physiological state. Such
information may be conveyed through behavioural, chemical, acoustic, or physiological
cues, including hormonal signals such as cortisol or reproductive hormones, and does
not necessarily result in an immediate or observable response from the receiver. Over
the course of evolution, natural selection shaped emotions that enhance an organism’s
ability to respond appropriately to environmental threats and opportunities [1]. In par-
allel, ecological and social pressures led to the emergence of species-specific repertoires
of communicative signals, forming the characteristic “communication rituals” observed
across taxa. Intraspecific communication is essential for regulating social distance, coor-
dinating behaviour, and facilitating group decision-making. Animals exchange visual,
acoustic, chemical, and body-movement signals, with the choice of modality influenced
by environmental conditions and social context. The literature commonly distinguishes
several primary channels of information transfer: tactile, chemical, acoustic, and visual
communication [2]. Their functions are studied within the discipline of zoosemiotics, which
aims to assess species’ capacities to develop symbolic signalling systems, interpret the
meaning of signals in context, and evaluate the effectiveness of specific modalities under
particular ecological conditions [3]. In interactions with humans, animals employ many of
the same signals used in intraspecific communication. Dogs, for instance, closely observe
human behaviour, are able to infer intentions, and can distinguish deliberate actions from
accidental ones. Through their own signals primarily elements of body language they
communicate emotions, needs, and motivational states [4,5]. Although animals possess a
less elaborate communicative repertoire than humans, they rely on natural, evolutionarily
shaped mechanisms of information exchange. Among canids, body language plays a
central role in maintaining social hierarchies, preventing conflict, and initiating affiliative
interactions such as play. In felids, vocal communication is comparatively more prominent:

research indicates that acoustic signals carry greater functional weight than body language
in both cat–cat communication and cat–human interactions [6,7].
In domesticated animals, interspecific communication, comprising interactions be-
tween heterospecific individuals, plays a particularly important role, especially in ex-
changes between animals and humans. Among the species that have developed highly
specialised skills enabling flexible communication with humans, dogs are especially promi-
nent [8]. They are also the species with the longest history of coexistence with humans,
estimated in some sources to span approximately 30,000 years [9]. The ease with which
dogs communicate with humans likely stems from the fact that they employ much of the
same signalling repertoire in human-directed interactions as in intraspecific communica-
tion [10]. Importantly, many of these social-behavioural signals align closely with human
social and emotional processing systems, facilitating mutual understanding, bonding, and
cooperative interaction. In social species, accurate identification of another individual’s
emotional state is essential, as emotions regulate the course of social behaviours and shape
decision-making processes. In domesticated animals, emotional communication occurs
both within species and in human–animal interactions. Research has demonstrated that
dogs and horses can recognise the emotional content of human and conspecific signals
based on single sensory modalities, including acoustic cues [11], facial expressions [12],
and olfactory signals [13]. Evidence of interspecific communication has also been reported
for other domesticated species [14,15].
This review integrates three complementary perspectives on mammalian communica-
tion: (1) the biological and ethological foundations of signalling across sensory modalities,
(2) the role of emotions and neurobiological mechanisms in shaping communicative pro-
cesses, and (3) the implications of communication for welfare assessment, training, and
emerging technological applications, including Precision Livestock Farming and Animal–
Computer Interaction. Rather than providing a purely species-by-species account, the
review aims to identify shared principles underlying communication across domesticated
and farmed mammals while acknowledging species-specific adaptations.
The aim of this article is to provide an integrated overview of current knowledge on
mammalian communication—from its biological and neurobiological foundations, through
the emotional and social mechanisms underlying information transfer, to the influence of
domestication and human interaction on the evolution of communicative signals. This
review synthesises findings from ethology, neurobiology, and applied behavioural sciences,
with particular attention to practical applications in welfare assessment, training, and
emerging technologies such as Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI) and Precision Livestock
Farming (PLF).
The overarching objective is to present communication as a multidimensional system
that integrates emotion, cognition, and social adaptation, and to highlight how under-
standing these mechanisms can improve human–animal relationships and the welfare of
domesticated animal species.
2. Forms of Animal Communications
A wide variety of communicative forms exist in the animal kingdom, shaped both by
the divergent evolutionary trajectories of species and by environmental changes associated
with human activity. In domesticated species, the processes of domestication and subse-
quent selective breeding have further modified certain modes of communication. Animals
rely on multiple senses and sensory modalities to transmit and receive signals [16]. These
senses constitute the basis of the sensory apparatus that enables organisms to gather infor-
mation about their surroundings. In most vertebrates, the primary sensory systems include
vision, hearing, olfaction, taste, and touch. However, some groups have evolved additional

modalities, such as electroreception in certain fish, magnetoreception in some bird species,
echolocation in bats and cetaceans, or infrared detection in select reptiles [17]. Depending
on the importance of each sense in the biology and behaviour of a given species, they have
evolved into a single, characteristic form. The forms used by animals include visual com-
munication, auditory communication, chemical communication, tactile communication,
and body language [18,19].
2.1. The Role of Touch in Animal Communication
Tactile communication is a form of direct signal transmission and is typically pre-
ceded by other modalities, such as visual, acoustic, or olfactory cues. Because physical
contact requires close spatial proximity, touch plays a particularly important role in social
interactions in which individuals must approach one another. The most common forms of
tactile communication include mutual rubbing, grooming behaviours, caregiving activities,
and comfort-related actions such as licking, scratching, or leaning against one another.
However, tactile signals may also function to communicate the need for increased distance
or to establish behavioural boundaries between interacting individuals. Such signals can
include biting, scratching, kicking, or forceful pushing and should be interpreted as context-
dependent, dyadic communication reflecting immediate motivational states rather than
as indicators of stable social rank or hierarchical structure. Tactile signals are detected by
mechanoreceptors located within the epidermis and dermis [20]. In many species, vibrissae
(specialised tactile hairs located primarily on the head) also contribute to fine mechanical
perception and facilitate nuanced tactile exploration [21]. Tactile communication is espe-
cially widespread in species that form structured social groups [22]. Elephants, for example,
use their trunk during social interactions to convey greetings, assess the reproductive or
emotional state of partners, offer reassurance, and communicate information related to
health [23,24]. Across many mammals, mutual grooming strengthens social bonds, partic-
ularly between mothers and offspring, and promotes post-conflict reconciliation and the
reduction in social tension [22]. Touch also accompanies play and agonistic interactions,
where it may serve as a signal initiating play, drawing attention, or contributing to the
establishment of dominance. In such contexts, sequences of tactile behaviours may include
nudging, gentle biting, or pushing [25]. Tactile contact is likewise an important component
of communication between dogs and humans. Physical touch functions as an affiliative
signal and exerts a calming effect on both the dog and its caregiver [26]. Human–dog
relationships are strengthened through appropriately tailored physical contact—petting
in preferred areas promotes bonding, reduces stress, and increases willingness to engage
socially. Relaxed dogs show reduced reactivity and greater readiness to initiate or maintain
interactions with humans [27].
Sensory systems play a pivotal role in the generation of sexual behaviour in animals.
Such behaviours arise from the interaction between the organisms’ internal physiological
state and external environmental cues that modulate arousal and readiness to mate [28].
Among the stimuli involved in communication between sexual partners, visual, acoustic,
olfactory, and tactile cues are of primary importance, with their effectiveness determined
by the sensitivity of the corresponding receptors and sensory organs [29]. Tactile stimuli
become particularly significant at the moment of direct contact between males and females.
Physical touch provides the male with information about the female’s receptivity, while
simultaneously facilitating and enhancing her sexual responses. In pigs, for example, a
sow in estrus responds to tactile stimulation from a boar by assuming a characteristic
immobile, lordotic mating posture [30]. In the presence of a male, estrus behaviours in sows
become more pronounced; females often adopt a rigid, arched-back posture that facilitates
mounting and penetration. In some cases, contact with an inactive or inexperienced boar

may elicit vigorous nudging or pushing by the female. In contrast, during the post-estrus
phase, females exhibit aversion to tactile stimulation and reject mounting attempts [31].
In sheep, an estrus ewe may rub her neck and torso against a nearby ram, and tactile
stimulation of her external genitalia by the male frequently induces urination, which
functions as a combined chemical–behavioural signal [32]. Female cattle also actively
participate in courtship interactions: they rub against the bull, sniff and lick his body, and,
in the pre-estrus phase, become increasingly aroused and socially attentive. During this
period, cows readily initiate contact with conspecifics, rubbing against them, licking them,
and engaging in behaviours such as mounting, head pressing, and pushing [33,34].
2.2. Visual Communication
Visual communication relies on the use of vision to perceive signals generated by other
individuals. Information is conveyed primarily through gestures, movements, and body
postures. Visual signals consist of controlled motor patterns that incorporate morphological
elements capable of attracting the receiver’s attention, such as movements of the ears,
tail, muzzle, or other body parts [6]. External appearance, including colouration and
body patterning, also plays an important role, serving as either social cues or deterrent
signals. However, the effectiveness of this mode of communication is limited in species
that are nocturnal or subterranean, where light availability is low [35–37]. Illumination
is therefore a key factor influencing the efficiency of visual signals, under favourable
lighting conditions, animals can employ more complex and subtle optical cues [38,39].
Despite this, visual communication can also be effective under dim-light conditions. Many
nocturnal mammals possess dichromatic colour vision and contrasting achromatic patterns
(black–white markings), enhancing signal discrimination, even under moonlight [36]. Some
nocturnal species additionally exhibit ultraviolet sensitivity and biofluorescence, with
their fur displaying fluorescent patterns upon exposure to UV light [40]. For instance,
the distinctive facial markings of the plains vizcacha (Lagostomus maximus) may function
as antipredator signals, similar to the contrasting facial rings observed in various lemur
species [36,41].
The ability to perceive light, colours, and patterns depends on the sensory adaptations
of each species, which is mirrored in the broad morphological diversity of mammalian
colouration. For example, many rodent species exhibit black–white striping or other con-
trasting head markings, whereas in coatis the ringed tail serves as a visual signal facilitating
group coordination during foraging or movement through dense vegetation [42]. Ani-
mals living in cohesive social groups commonly use variation in body posture and facial
expressions, particularly those involving the head, to communicate emotional states and
behavioural intentions [43,44]. Domestic sheep can discriminate characteristic structural
and colour features of the head, not only in other sheep, but also in individuals of other
species, including humans. Studies have demonstrated that sheep are capable of recog-
nising human faces from photographs [45,46]. This ability has also been documented in
horses [47] and dogs [48]. The capacity to identify unfamiliar faces from images is a trait
shared by humans and certain primates [49,50], requiring sophisticated, holistic processing
of visual stimuli [51,52]. Facial recognition of the same species has similarly been reported
in cattle [53], horses [54], dogs [55], and goats [56].
Visual communication also plays an important role in sexual selection as well as in
signalling age, condition, or social status. In pigs, sexual activity is shaped by a complex
interaction between the animal’s physiological state and environmental stimuli, including
visual cues generated by a potential mate [57–59]. In some primate species, colourful
patches of skin and fur function as indicators of health, social rank, or reproductive readi-
ness [60].

The use of colour in visual communication, particularly in signalling reproductive sta-
tus and mediating social interactions, was described as early as Darwin’s classical writings
on sexual selection [61]. Body colouration is widely employed in intraspecific communi-
cation, serving both social and sexual functions [62]. Distinctive and contrasting colours
expressed by males and females may serve as indicators of genetic quality and reproductive
potential, a phenomenon frequently observed in socially living primates [63,64]. For exam-
ple, dark mane colouration in male lions is associated with superior physical condition and
high testosterone levels, increasing male attractiveness to females [65]. In many primate
species, males exhibit more intense colouration than females, facilitating the signalling
of dominance and social status. Primates possess highly developed visual systems, and
visual communication plays a central role in their daily interactions, with acuity and colour
discrimination underpinning a wide range of social behaviours [66]. Colouration is often
used to generate visual signals in body regions that are readily visible to conspecifics. In
numerous primate species, facial and perineal colouration is particularly visible to indi-
viduals of the same species. The intensity, distribution, and patterning of these colours are
strongly linked to male–male competition and status signalling [67,68]. In rhesus macaques
(Macaca mulatta), for instance, males with more intense red facial colouration receive greater
sexual acceptance from females than males with pale pink faces [69].
Animals also employ visual communication in antipredator contexts. Conspicuous
colouration functions as a warning signal, indicating toxicity or the high cost of attack. Such
signals consist of combinations of features including colour, contrast, symmetry, and body
shape [70]. In terrestrial animals, aposematic displays often involve combinations of red,
orange, and yellow [71]. Studies on the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus) have shown that preda-
tors attend more strongly to dominant colour than to specific pattern details [72]. Similarly,
research on poison frogs of the genus Epipedobates demonstrates that their conspicuous
colouration serves as an effective deterrent to potential predators [73].
2.3. Body Language
Animals convey essential information through body postures, facial expressions, ear
and tail position, and eye expression. The ability to perceive and interpret the emotional
signals of conspecifics is particularly important in species living in social groups [74].
Domestic animals have developed a rich repertoire of signals used in both intraspecific
and interspecific communication, especially with humans. Dogs initiate play through the
characteristic “play bow,” in which the forelimbs are extended forward and the hindquarters
are raised, often accompanied by rapid tail wagging [75]. Dogs are widely regarded
as exceptionally well adapted to human social environments; they exhibit high social
tolerance and pronounced social attentiveness, enabling flexible adjustment to human
actions and communicative cues [76]. This is particularly relevant in contemporary contexts
in which dogs function as family members and partners in daily social interactions [77].
Additional play-related signals include dynamic hindquarter movements [78,79]. Rolling
onto the back with the belly exposed, observed in both dogs and cats, may serve as an
invitation to play rather than solely a signal of submission [80–82]. Social play fulfils
an important communicative function and typically emerges under conditions of low
stress. It is characterised by variability, flexibility, and a degree of unpredictability [83].
Despite its seemingly unstructured nature, play follows specific rules, and violations of
these rules may lead to escalation, conflict, or even aggression [84]. In cats, the motivation
to initiate play with a human frequently manifests as “stalking” behaviour performed
nearby, accompanied by dilated pupils and forward-oriented ears, an expression indicating
heightened arousal and readiness for interaction [82,85].

Body language is also used to communicate threat, submission, and attempts to
regulate distance during social interactions, both toward other animals and toward humans.
In cats, such signalling involves approaching an intruder trespassing on occupied
territory and maintaining prolonged, intense staring [86]. Preparatory cues for an attack
include forward-directed vibrissae and elevated hindquarters, which visually “enlarge” the
body. These threatening and aggressive behaviours function as communicative strategies
aimed at deterring another individual or object and prompting withdrawal [87].
Dogs display a wide range of postures in which the configuration of the body reflects
their emotional state, motivational context, and behavioural intentions [88]. An upright
stance, a forward-extended chest, and piloerection along the neck may indicate that a dog
is preparing to defend its territory or perceives a potential threat [10]. Additional threat-
related signals include erect ears, tense facial musculature, and marked piloerection [89].
Dogs exhibiting threatening behaviour typically adopt a posture characterised by ears
flattened or oriented forward, a raised tail, bristled neck hair, the head thrust forward,
exposed teeth, tightened lips, rounded mouth corners, and wrinkling of the nasal region [90].
These behaviours should be interpreted as context-dependent communicative signals that
may reflect fear, arousal, or defensive motivation, rather than exclusively as expressions of
dominance or aggression.
In dogs, signalling confidence, vigilance, or perceived threat involves increasing
apparent body size by straightening the posture, tensing the musculature, or extending
to full height. Conversely, dogs can reduce their “perceived size” by lowering the body
and tail and flattening the ears, thereby avoiding conflict in uncertain or challenging
situations [10,91,92]. An upright posture is associated with dominance displays, whereas
ear and lip position contributes to signalling aggression or submission [93]. A fearful dog
adopts a submissive stance: the ears are laid back, direct eye contact is avoided, the tail
is tucked, and the muzzle may appear wrinkled around the nostrils. The head is often
lowered or turned aside, and the body assumes a crouched position with flexed limbs.
Such a dog may also expose its abdomen while simultaneously covering the genital area
with the tail, an unambiguous sign of submission [94]. In communication with humans,
dogs additionally employ referential gestures, directing their gaze and orienting their body
toward a specific object to elicit an appropriate response from the caregiver [4].
Facial expressions are another important communicative tool in both dogs and
cats [4,95]. The configuration of the muzzle provides valuable cues about the animal’s
emotional state and motivational stance. In dogs, retracted lips and forward-oriented
ears indicate readiness to play. In contrast, a lowered head, ears pulled back, crouching,
or extending the forelimbs are signs of withdrawal. Indicators of uncertainty or social
discomfort include wide-open eyes directed toward the caregiver, slight ear elevation, and
a closed mouth [96]. In cats, curiosity is expressed through intense staring at the human,
forward-facing erect ears, and fully open, bright eyes, characterised by increased ocular
openness and pupil visibility associated with heightened arousal and attentiveness [74].
Dogs and cats display characteristic facial expressions during states of depression
or low mood. In dogs, such states are reflected in partially closed eyes, a sombre facial
appearance, and noticeable relaxation of the facial musculature [97]. In cats, signs of sad-
ness include a fixed, “vacant” gaze and reduced facial muscle tension. Conversely, content
and relaxed individuals show overall bodily looseness; in cats the ears remain steady
and motionless, whereas in dogs they may be slightly elevated [98,99]. Facial and head
expressions therefore serve as valuable tools for assessing welfare in companion animals.
Alterations in facial musculature or ear position may indicate the presence of pain or stress,
a relationship documented in several species including cattle [100], horses [54], sheep [101],
pigs [102,103], and cats [104]. Facial expressivity appears particularly developed in domes-

ticated animals, likely due to their long evolutionary and social history with humans. A
notable example is the ability of dogs to raise their eyebrows, producing a juvenile-like
expression; this capability is absent in wolves, whose facial musculature does not allow
such movements [105]. Facial expressions play a key role in nonverbal communication,
enabling animals both to express their own emotions and to recognise the emotional states
of others [106]. Body language and facial movements facilitate the expression of emotions
such as happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger, and fear. Owner-based studies have
shown that behavioural indicators of fear in dogs include hiding or escape attempts, pant-
ing, yawning, lip-licking, avoidance of eye contact, a lowered body posture, ears pinned
back, and a tail carried low or tucked between the legs [107]. Experimental studies using
positive and negative stimuli demonstrate that dogs respond to positive cues by widening
their eyes, orienting their gaze forward, and straightening and stabilising their ears [108].
The eyes are a central element of body language, functioning not only as sensory
organs but also as active transmitters of social information. Among communicative signals,
eye contact, particularly in dogs, stands out as one of the most influential and effective
means of conveying information. Facial expression is a core component of emotional
responses in social mammals, and dogs display a natural tendency to gaze at human
faces and engage in eye contact in various contexts, including when requesting food or
awaiting instructions [86]. Eyes are also used to transmit emotional states to other indi-
viduals. Staring at another animal or at a human may indicate a threat, whereas gaze
aversion serves as a calming signal that reduces tension [96]. In relaxed situations, dogs’
eyes typically appear “soft”; in contrast, a hard, intense stare, often accompanied by a
furrowed brow, signals high arousal or stress. Direct and prolonged eye contact with an
unfamiliar human can be interpreted as a sign of aggression [96]. When confronted with an
angry owner, dogs generally avert their gaze, displaying a de-escalatory response [78,108].
Eye-tracking studies show that dogs focus primarily on the eye region when processing the
facial expressions of animals of the same species [109]. Cross-species emotion recognition
is more challenging, as key emotional cues are often species-specific. Evidence suggests
that domestication and prolonged coexistence with humans have shaped distinct visual
signals in dogs that differ from those used in intraspecific communication. Domesticated
dogs exhibit a spontaneous tendency to gaze at human faces and initiate eye contact [110].
Typically, such gaze behaviour functions as a request most often for food [111] or other
forms of assistance. Thus, a gaze directed at humans operates as a solicitation signal [96],
whereas in interactions between dogs the same behaviour would more commonly signal a
threat or challenge [4]. This indicates that dogs employ eye contact differently with humans
than with conspecifics. Gaze directly at humans has acquired a positive, affiliative meaning
and facilitates dog–human interaction. Overall, these findings suggest that the domes-
tication process has functionally modified gaze behaviour, adapting it for interspecific
communication and aligning it more closely with human modes of social signalling [112].
Companion cats often occupy the same anthropogenic social niche as dogs, and their
eyes play a key role in communication. Relaxed cats exhibit characteristic slow blinking,
which serves as a signal of comfort and contentment. In contrast, frightened individuals
display round, dilated pupils; pupil dilation also occurs during preparatory stages of
attack or in self-defence situations [6,113]. Direct gazing in cats most commonly appears in
contexts where they attempt to interpret human intentions or behaviour [114].
Ear movements and positioning also constitute essential communicative tools across
many mammalian species. The ears of dogs and cats are highly mobile—each species
possesses approximately 20 muscles controlling pinna orientation, enabling precise sound
localisation as well as the expression of emotional states. In dogs, ear posture conveys
substantial information about mood: slightly raised ears indicate security and content-

ment [4], erect ears enhance acoustic localisation [115], whereas ears held tightly back
may signal intense fear [116,117]. Forward-directed ears typically denote interest. In cats,
upright, twitching ears reflect heightened attentiveness to stimuli. Content and alert cats
hold their ears upright and slightly forward. A cat anticipating a threat positions its ears
straight back, whereas a frightened cat flattens its ears laterally against the head. Rapid ear
flicking indicates the detection of a particularly salient sound [6,98,118]. A cat preparing to
attack flattens its ears while slightly retracting the head; a fearful cat flattens its ears more
drastically and withdraws the head further [74].
Body language and ear posture also play a crucial role in emotional expression in
horses. Movements of the ears, eye reactions, and tension in the lips and nostrils pro-
vide rich information about an individual’s emotional state. Bored horses display loosely
drooped ears positioned backwards and slightly apart, half-closed eyes, and relaxed, pen-
dulous lips; yawning is common. They may also paw the ground or stamp, signalling
impatience [119–121]. Vigilance is characterised by vertically oriented ears, wide-open
eyes, flared nostrils, and an elevated head-and-neck posture [122,123]. Curious horses
direct their ears toward the object of interest, stand squarely on all four limbs, and hold
the tail raised or gently relaxed. Soft visual tracking and quiet snorting indicate positive
engagement [124–126]. Content horses display softly positioned ears slightly angled back-
ward and a gently lowered head [127,128]. Aroused horses exhibit upright ears, increased
muscle tension, wide-open eyes, and an elevated tail, and such arousal may be positive
(e.g., play, excitement) or sexual in nature. In this state, horses may run, buck, or engage
in rolling behaviours [129]. Frightened horses hold their ears stiffly forward, tighten the
lips, tense the body, widen the eyes such that the sclera becomes visible, and may pro-
duce loud vocalisations—whinnies, squeals, or snorts—signalling fear, threat, distress,
or discomfort [130]. Indicators of aggression include rigidly positioned ears flattened
backwards, a tense posture, and wide-open eyes with visible sclera. This configuration
typically serves as a warning, though it may precede defensive actions such as kicking or
biting. Ears held sharply backward signal uncertainty, irritation, overt threat, and readi-
ness to attack [131–133]. Agonistic behaviours may be expressed by rearing on the hind
legs, lifting the forequarters, and striking with the forelimbs. These actions can occur in
aggressive contexts but are also frequently observed during play or heightened arousal and
should therefore not be interpreted exclusively as indicators of dominance or fixed social
order [134,135].
Across many mammalian species, the tail plays a central role in communication. Tail
position and movement, in combination with facial expressions, form complex signal configu-
rations that correspond to distinct emotional states. Owing to its length and mobility, the tail
is a highly salient signalling structure, capable of conveying information over long distances
and allowing for substantial variability in meaning [136,137]. The communicative use of the
tail is best documented in domestic dogs. Tail posture and dynamics provide insight into
the animal’s intentions and emotional state. A tail held high typically signals confidence,
arousal, or the motivation to initiate interaction, such as during greeting or play [4,138]. A
stiffly held tail may indicate anxiety or perceived threat [139], whereas a loosely hanging tail
reflects relaxation and the absence of stress. A stiff, elevated tail often accompanies dominant
behaviour. Conversely, a low, gently wagging tail is typical of subordinate individuals, while a
tail tucked tightly between the hind limbs signals fear, uncertainty, or conflict de-escalation by
reducing the animal’s apparent body size [140,141]. Dogs that are alert or highly stimulated
wag their tails vigorously, often with wide-amplitude movements [10,93,142]. Tail base height
has also been identified as an indicator of social status, a phenomenon first described in
wolves [143] and later confirmed in domestic dogs [144]. In cats, the tail likewise constitutes a
key component of body language. Rapid tail lashing generally signals arousal or irritation and

often warns that the animal should not be approached [145,146]. A fully erect, piloerected tail
indicates fear or aggression. A tail held straight and relaxed suggests a neutral state, whereas
a vertically raised tail is an affiliative signal. Cafazzo and Natoli [147] termed this posture the
“tail-up display”, characteristic of friendly social interactions among cats. Studies on urban
feral cat colonies show that this signal occurs more frequently in females than in males and
is more commonly expressed by lower-ranking individuals. A bristled tail held downward
reflects unease or threat perception, whereas a tail tucked beneath the body indicates fear and
submission [140]. A raised tail with a slightly lowered tip is often associated with excitement
or positive anticipation. In horses, tail movements also serve as salient indicators of emotional
state. Vigorous tail swishing against the flanks can indicate irritation or frustration, while a
tail tightly clamped under the hindquarters suggests fear or uncertainty. In contrast, a tail
held high is characteristic of horses that are joyful, excited, or highly aroused [148,149].
Across species, these postural and facial signals serve a common function of regulating
social distance, signalling emotional state, and coordinating interactions, despite differences
in morphology and ecological context.
2.4. Acoustic Communications in Animals
The ability to recognise conspecifics based on auditory signals has been demonstrated
in dogs [91,150], horses [151], pigs [152], and cats [13]. Acoustic signals can travel over
considerable distances, although their transmission is often disrupted by acoustic noise,
which masks the original signal and impairs perception [153,154]. The auditory sense plays
a critical role in the lives of both wild and domestic animals [155]. Because the hearing
range of many species differs substantially from that of humans, animals may respond
to sounds that are inaudible to their caretakers. Such reactions, triggered by stimuli be-
yond the human auditory threshold, can be sudden, intense, and difficult to predict, with
important implications for animal safety and welfare [155,156]. The diversity of acoustic
signals arises partly from anatomical variation in the vocal apparatus. Animals are capable
of producing sounds through multiple mechanisms. For example, elephants communicate
not only through vocalisations but also by generating seismic signals via ground impacts;
their low-frequency rumbles facilitate individual recognition [157]. Animals use sounds
across a broad frequency range, from infrasonic signals below 20 Hz to ultrasonic signals
above 20 kHz. Certain rodent species communicate using infrasound below 10 Hz [158].
Ultrasonic signals, although less suitable for long-distance transmission, play a key role in
the social communication of rodents, bats, and many cetaceans [159]. Bats, dolphins, and
porpoises employ high-frequency sounds both for echolocation and for social communi-
cation. However, acoustic strategies among cetaceans are highly diverse. Some species,
particularly large baleen whales, primarily use low-frequency sounds to communicate
over long distances, whereas toothed whales, including dolphins, tend to rely on higher-
frequency vocalisations such as whistles, chirps, and burst-pulsed sounds. An exception is
the production of low-frequency narrow-band signals by some toothed whales in specific
social contexts. In aquatic environments, sound propagates more rapidly and over longer
distances than in air, further increasing the functional value of acoustic signalling in marine
mammals [160]. The types of vocal signals produced also depend on the social system of
a given species. Acoustic signals may serve as alarm cues, such as vocalisations emitted
during territorial intrusions [161]. In gibbons and howler monkeys, loud calls are central to
intergroup competition [162,163]. Many species use distinct calls to warn conspecifics of
predators; for instance, marmots produce acoustically varied alarm whistles depending on
the nature of the threat [164]. In reproductive contexts, males of numerous species employ
acoustic displays as part of mate competition. During rutting season, male cervids emit

Animals 2026, 16, 265

powerful roars that signal physical condition and strength; individuals producing louder
and more resonant vocalisations are preferred by females [165].
Dogs use eight principal types of vocal signals in intraspecific communication [166,167].
High-pitched barking is most commonly associated with submissiveness or juvenile be-
haviour, and in some contexts may indicate excitement, playfulness, or solicitation directed
at a human handler or another dog. In contrast, low-pitched barking typically occurs in
situations involving threat or territorial defence, particularly when a stranger approaches
the dog’s territory [168,169]. Small dog breeds often exhibit intense, persistent barking,
which functions as a warning signal directed toward larger animals [170–172].
Humans are able to distinguish among different types of barking and whining and
to attribute distinct meanings to them, which facilitates the interpretation of canine in-
tentions and enables appropriate behavioural responses [4]. Dogs use whining both as
an attention-seeking signal directed at the caregiver and in submissive contexts, thereby
communicating low social status. Whining may also indicate a need to go outside or enter
a room, as well as discomfort or pain; in some dogs, it occurs without an identifiable
external trigger [173]. Growling represents another vocal signal, most often preceding
aggressive behaviour. A growling dog communicates the seriousness of the situation and
typically demands an increase in distance. Although growling may function solely as a
threat display, it is crucial to distinguish this form of signalling from cues that indicate a
genuine risk of aggression [169]. Howling serves both as a long-distance communication
signal between dogs and as an indicator of loneliness or anxiety. Vocal reactivity varies
markedly between individuals [167,174] and is also influenced by breed. Some breeds (such
as the Basenji, Chow Chow, or Shar Pei) show low vocal propensity, whereas others bark
more frequently [172,175]. Barking primarily functions as a territorial signal, while whining
is used mainly to elicit caregiving behaviours from conspecifics or humans [167,176].
Acoustic signals constitute important indicators of dogs’ emotional states and motiva-
tional processes. Analyses of vocalisations can discriminate between positive and negative
affective states [177]. Research also suggests sex-related differences, with males exhibiting
higher vocal activity than females [178]. Age additionally affects vocal behaviour: adult
dogs, due to their established social position and caregiving roles, emit more acoustic
signals (barks, growls, whines) than younger individuals [179,180].
Cats express both positive and negative emotional states through a diverse range of
vocal signals. The most commonly produced vocalisation in domestic cats is the meow.
Vocal activity is especially pronounced in kittens that have been properly socialised with
humans from an early age. The feline vocal repertoire spans a wide spectrum of sounds,
from soft purring to loud, intense calls associated with agonistic encounters or reproductive
behaviours [181]. Domestic cats possess a more extensive and complex vocal repertoire
than any other member of the order Carnivora and are substantially more vocal than their
wild ancestor, the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) [182]. In free-ranging cats, including
those living in social groups, vocalisation is markedly reduced, their communication is
far quieter compared to that of domestic cats [183]. Three primary contexts of feline vocal
communication are traditionally distinguished: mother–offspring interactions, agonistic
encounters (fighting, aggression, competition), and sexual behaviour [183,184]. To these
one must add cat–human communication, which has emerged and diversified through
the process of domestication. Research has demonstrated that cats can recognise their
own name when spoken by humans [185]. Domesticated cats have been shaped not only
by selective breeding but also by prolonged coexistence with humans, resulting in the
development of specialised vocal strategies directed specifically toward people [186,187].
Meowing exemplifies this specialisation: it is rare in cat–cat interactions yet constitutes one
of the most frequently used signals in cat–human communication. Meowing in its current

form is believed to be a domestication-driven adaptation functioning primarily to attract
human attention [188]. From an evolutionary perspective, it has been proposed that cats
more effectively using meows to elicit caretaker responses would have received greater
support and thus enjoyed higher survival rates [189].
Feline vocalisations can be broadly classified into three categories: tonal calls (meows),
purr-like sounds, and loud defensive or aggressive signals such as hisses, spits, and
screams [190]. In social contexts, short and gentle meows function as greeting signals
or expressions of positive engagement with humans. Conversely, long, drawn-out meows
often indicate frustration or dissatisfaction, particularly when the cat is attempting to
prompt a specific human response. Purring is among the most frequently observed feline
vocalisations and has a dual function: it typically signals comfort and contentment, but may
also occur during stress, pain, or illness. Chattering a rapid, staccato sound usually emerges
when a cat observes stimuli that strongly evoke predatory motivation, such as birds outside
a window. During play, cats may emit short squeaks. Purring accompanied by forward-
directed or laterally splayed vibrissae and tense facial muscles may signal irritation or
serve as a warning of potential aggression. Loud hissing, spitting, screaming, and growling
are characteristic of agonistic contexts and sexual encounters, occurring both as defensive
responses to threats and as elements of competition or territorial defence [181,191]. Hissing
functions primarily as a deterrent, whereas loud screams commonly accompany direct
physical altercations or injuries. Growling in cats may serve both offensive and defensive
roles, signalling readiness to fight or protect oneself. Demand meowing is typically loud
and prolonged, with vocal intensity increasing progressively if the desired outcome is not
achieved. Sex-related differences in feline vocalisations have also been documented. Males
produce characteristic calls during courtship and copulation, whereas females vocalise
more intensely during estrus and when interacting with their offspring [192,193].
Farm animals likewise use acoustic signals to communicate emotional states. In pigs,
short grunts are associated with positive affect, whereas loud squeals often reflect pain or
stress. Cattle express distress through low-frequency moos, while positive-emotion states
such as excitement or anticipation are characterised by higher-frequency calls. Horses,
although generally less vocal, emit soft whinnies as greeting or contact calls, whereas
groans or grunts may indicate fatigue or boredom [156,194].
Despite species-specific sensory adaptations, the underlying communicative function
of these signals is conserved across mammals, enabling the transmission of emotional and
motivational information.
2.5. Chemical Communication
Chemical communication is based on the exchange of information encoded in odorant
substances released by the organism. Olfactory cues influence the behaviour of both
conspecifics and heterospecifics. The key advantages of chemical signals include their
long persistence in the environment, the possibility of transmitting information regardless
of the time of day, and their high efficacy even at very low concentrations. Animals use
scent communication for species identification, sex and individual recognition, locating
reproductive partners, deterring rivals, marking territories, and warning group members of
potential threats [195–197]. Chemical cues are released via urine, faeces, and the secretions
of numerous scent glands. In most mammals, these glands are located in the areas of
the head, anogenital region, inguinal region, and paw pads. In many species, social
encounters typically begin with sniffing of the anogenital area [198,199]. In felids, scent
glands located around the head are particularly well studied, while in hoofed animals,
chemical cues originating from the interdigital glands play a crucial role in social and
territorial signalling [200,201].
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani16020265

Animals 2026, 16, 265

Urine and faeces serve as additional sources of chemical signals used in communi-
cation [30,202,203]. Information encoded in faeces about the type of diet enables species
or population recognition, and the composition of the gut microbiota may indicate an
individual’s health status [204]. Many carnivores, such as the red fox, domestic cat, and
dog, use faeces to mark territory and signal their presence [205]. During the mating season,
urine provides information about an individual’s physiological status, with the scent of
urine allowing discrimination of sex, health condition, and, in females, the phase of the
reproductive cycle [206].
Information centres and deterrent signals can also be established through rubbing parts of
the body against environmental objects, other individuals, or their own body. This behaviour is
characteristic, for example, of bears and weasels [207,208]. Bats use chemical cues to recognise
conspecifics, identify sex and colony members [209], and mark objects to deter rivals [210]. In
some primate species, males deposit scent marks from their genital area during the breeding
season, signalling reproductive condition and attracting females [211].
Chemical communication also plays a significant role in domesticated species. Dogs
can discriminate individual humans by scent, and preferred sniffing regions on the body
suggest that different anatomical areas emit distinct chemical cues [212,213]. It has been
demonstrated that emotion-related odours, such as those associated with fear, joy, or anger
elicit different behavioural responses in dogs [214]. Fear-related scents increase vigilance
and anxiety, whereas odours associated with joy evoke affiliative behaviours, such as tail
wagging or licking [215]. Depending on the emotional valence of the olfactory stimulus,
dogs may also adjust the intensity of their interaction with humans, odours of familiar
or bonded individuals increase interest and proximity seeking, whereas the scent of an
unfamiliar person elicits greater caution [4].
Olfactory communication is equally important in cats. Through scent, cats mark
territory, recognise individuals, and maintain social bonds. A key structure involved
in chemical communication is the vomeronasal organ (Jacobson’s organ), located above
the palate, which enables the detection and analysis of pheromones and other chemical
cues [216]. Rubbing behaviour directed at objects, other animals, or humans serves both to
exchange social information and to deposit the cat’s scent onto environmental elements.
This enables, among other functions, the recognition of estrus females by males and the
identification of shared territory [217].
Although species differ in their specific signalling repertoires, all mammals rely on
four primary communication modalities: visual, acoustic, chemical, and tactile. Each
provides distinct adaptive advantages and varying degrees of resistance to environmental
disturbance. Table 1 summarises these modalities, outlining their functions, applications,
and typical limitations.

3. Communication in Social Groups (Social Structures, Hierarchies,
Networks)
Communication constitutes a fundamental mechanism underlying the organisation of
social structures in mammals. While classical ethology often described social organisation
in terms of linear dominance hierarchies, increasing evidence in domestic species such as
dogs and horses supports more flexible, relationship-based social structures characterised
by individual roles, social cohesion, and context-dependent agonistic interactions. Signals
do not merely reflect existing relationships; they actively shape them by influencing group
cohesion, the stability of social relationships, and the efficiency of information flow. Inte-
grating classical research on animal communication with social network analysis (SNA)
demonstrates that patterns of signal exchange reveal the direction, strength, and quality of
social connections, and can predict consequences for individual welfare, social status, and
reproductive success [218]. In most social species, relative social status and individual roles
within groups are communicated using multiple modalities, including chemical, visual,
acoustic, and postural signals. Such multimodal redundancy minimises the need for costly
physical confrontations, replacing them with ritualised displays, threats, and appeasement
behaviours. These “rules of engagement” stabilise group structure by reducing conflict
escalation and lowering the risk of injury. From a neuroethological perspective, status-
related signals engage specialised perceptual systems and modulate physiology, arousal,
and behavioural responses in real time [219]. Individual recognition represents another
key mechanism structuring social life. Variation in signal characteristics whether olfactory,
vocal, facial, or behavioural supports the identification of partners, allies, and competitors,
facilitating coordinated action and the maintenance of long-term social bonds.
This mechanism has been documented across numerous taxa and enables the precise
“addressing” of signals within a social network [43]. Social network analysis provides
quantitative metrics for assessing individual communication roles, such as degree, between-
ness centrality, and closeness centrality. These metrics link local interactions to emergent
properties of the entire group. Reviews indicate that individuals with high centrality
function as “information hubs”, accelerating the spread of alarm signals, behavioural in-
novations, or feeding preferences [220]. SNA also enables cross-species comparisons and
integration of long-term behavioural datasets with modern tracking technologies. In many
mammals, decisions regarding movement, foraging, or structural changes in fission–fusion
societies emerge from local interaction rules embedded within the network’s topology.
Both modelling studies and empirical data demonstrate transitions from centralised struc-
tures dominated by a single leader to decentralised systems in which decision-making is
distributed among group members. Communication patterns determining who sees, hears,
or follows whom influence the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of collective decisions [221].
Modern research techniques such as telemetry, biologgers, accelerometry, and
computer-vision systems allow the integration of spatial, behavioural, and multimodal
communication data. At the same time, generative network models enable the testing
of hypotheses about the emergence and dynamics of social structures in natural and an-
thropogenically altered environments. A major challenge remains the full integration of
communication research (signal modality, content, and context) with network topology
analyses, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms governing social life in
mammals [218]. Only through a combined analysis of “who interacts with whom and how
often” (SNA) and “what, how, and in what context is communicated” (signal analysis) can
we capture the processes through which communication creates, regulates, and transforms
animal societies. In domestic species, particularly dogs and horses, such communication
patterns often reflect relationship-based social organisation and context-dependent inter-
actions rather than rigid, linear hierarchies. Taken together, these examples illustrate that
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani16020265


---

Animals 2026, 16, 265
15 of 32
social communication in mammals relies on flexible, relationship-based interactions rather
than uniform, species-specific signalling systems.
3.1. The Role of Emotions and the Neurobiology of Communication
Animal communication relies not only on the exchange of sensory stimuli but also
on the ability to recognise, interpret, and mirror the emotional states of conspecifics. Emo-
tions constitute the neurobiological foundation of social behaviour, modulating attention,
motivation, and responses to communicative signals. In social mammals, the capacity
to perceive the emotions of group members and, in domesticated species, also human
emotions is crucial for maintaining social bonds and behavioural synchrony [222–224].
Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that mammalian brains exhibit homologous acti-
vation patterns when processing emotional signals. In both humans and dogs, similar areas
of the temporal cortex and amygdala are activated in response to vocalisations expressing
positive or negative affect [150]. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses show that dogs display heightened activity in limbic
structures and the prefrontal cortex when exposed to emotionally charged sounds, whether
canine or human [225]. This ability likely evolved during domestication and represents
a co-evolutionary perceptual adaptation between humans and dogs [226,227]. Compa-
rable neural correlates have been documented in cats, which can discriminate human
emotional states based on vocal intonation and facial expressions [74]. These mechanisms
align with the concept of emotional mirroring, which involves mirror-neuron networks
in the frontal and parietal cortices [228]. Emotion recognition requires the integration of
multisensory information—including visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile cues. Dogs
and horses can match facial expressions with vocal tone, detecting emotional congruence
across modalities [229]. Similar cross-modal integration has been shown in primates, where
activity in the superior temporal sulcus increases in response to emotionally congruent
audiovisual stimuli [230]. In dogs, this process involves coordinated activation of visual,
auditory, and limbic regions within an occipito-temporal cross-modal network identified
using fMRI [231]. From an ethological perspective, emotions serve as regulators of social
interactions. Positive affect promotes affiliation, play, and bonding, whereas negative emo-
tions (e.g., fear, anger) signal threat and initiate avoidance or defensive responses. In many
species (dogs, primates, and dolphins) emotion perception enables flexible behavioural
adjustments to the social context [223].
Emotions also modulate facial expression, vocalisation, and posture, influencing how
signals are interpreted by receivers [97]. Emotion recognition is closely linked to neurohor-
monal processes, particularly oxytocin and vasopressin, which mediate social bonding. In
dogs, mutual gaze with a human caregiver increases oxytocin levels in both partners [226].
This “oxytocin–gaze loop” provides a biological basis for interspecies empathy and emo-
tional communication. Emotional expression has clear neurophysiological correlates. Facial
movements, ear posture, and eye configuration reflect emotional arousal and welfare
state. Changes in facial muscle tension correlate with activity in premotor cortex and basal
ganglia, a phenomenon demonstrated in primates [232], pigs [103], and cats [233]. The de-
velopment of grimace scales has enabled quantitative assessment of emotional expression,
particularly in the context of pain and welfare [103].
The neurobiology of animal communication thus reveals that emotions are not merely
responses to stimuli but integral components of social signalling. Domestication has en-
hanced certain species’ (e.g., dogs’) capacity to perceive human emotions and has reshaped
neural circuits involved in processing social information. Emotions therefore form a shared
“interspecies language” a system of signals that enables cooperation, empathy, and mutual
understanding between animals and humans.

3.2. The Influence of Domestication and Human Interaction on Communicative Signals
Domestication alters not only the morphology and neurophysiology of signalling
systems but also the functions and use of the signals themselves. These phenomena are
captured within the concept of the domestication syndrome, which links selection for
tameness and human-directed cooperation with developmental modifications in neural
crest cell populations. Such changes have secondary effects on facial musculature, ear
and tail morphology, pigmentation patterns, and other structures that serve as carriers
of visual and acoustic signals [234]. In dogs, one of the most thoroughly documented
outcomes of domestication is the evolution of specialised facial musculature that facilitates
communication with humans. Of particular importance is the levator anguli oculi medialis
muscle (“inner brow raiser”), which is absent in wolves. Activation of this muscle elevates
the inner portion of the eyebrow, drawing human attention and enhancing the emotional
salience of the signal. This represents a morphological adaptation of the visual signalling
channel to interspecies communication [227]. Moreover, mutual gazing between dogs and
humans triggers a bidirectional increase in oxytocin levels, forming a positive feedback
mechanism, the so-called oxytocin–gaze loop, which strengthens social bonding and pro-
motes cooperative tendencies. This mechanism does not occur in wolves and is interpreted
as a product of coevolution between canine signalling strategies and human perceptual
biases [226]. In cats, components of the vocal repertoire have undergone functional shifts
toward human-directed communication. A classical example is the solicitation purr, a
purr containing a high-frequency element that effectively elicits caregiving responses from
humans. Recent research also demonstrates context-dependent variation in meow prosody,
supporting the idea of adaptive refinement of the acoustic channel in cat–human interac-
tions [182,189]. Domesticated ungulates likewise show human-oriented communicative
behaviours. Goats, for instance, modulate gaze and employ alternating looks in the “un-
solvable task” paradigm, with their behaviour depending on human attentional cues such
as body orientation and face direction [235]. This indicates that selection for cooperation
and close cohabitation with humans has favoured the emergence of referential signals and
socially mediated “tool use” in interspecies communication [235].
Not all outcomes of domestication, however, enhance communicative efficiency. Se-
lective breeding that drastically alters skull shape and facial configuration can reduce the
range of facial expressions and diminish emotional signalling precision relative to ancestral
forms. Comparative studies of canine facial expression reveal that some breeds exhibit a
constrained ability to produce specific affective displays, a noteworthy counterpoint to the
assumption that domestication universally improves communication [236].
Domestication and human influence therefore operate along two parallel pathways:
(1) they selectively amplify signals that effectively engage human perception and emo-
tion (e.g., canine eye expressions, feline vocal prosody, referential gaze in goats), while
(2) secondary morphological modifications may constrain the expressive repertoire and
reduce signalling precision. Understanding both of these vectors is essential for inter-
preting behaviour, assessing welfare, and designing evidence-based training practices for
domesticated species [182,226,227].
The process of domestication has profoundly modified the forms and functions of
communicative signals in dogs, producing a clear departure from patterns characteristic
of wolves. As a result, dogs display heightened sensitivity to human social cues and have
developed a set of behaviours specifically adapted for interspecies communication. Table 2
summarises key differences in wolf–dog–human communication, illustrating how selective
pressures associated with cohabitation with humans have generated unique communicative
mechanisms in dogs, distinct from those found in their wild ancestors and from typical
human signalling systems.

3.3. Communication in Farm Animals
Despite domestication, farm animals often inhabit environments that diverge sub-
stantially from their natural ecological and social conditions. Production systems and
facility infrastructure may restrict the expression of the full natural communicative reper-
toire. Nevertheless, these animals continuously perceive external stimuli and respond to
them accordingly. Noise associated with high stocking density, mechanical equipment,
and human traffic within housing facilities can induce hyperarousal, sleep disturbances,
distress, and ultimately impair psychological health [237]. Vocalisations produced under
intensive housing conditions do not always reflect species-typical communication; instead,
they frequently express emotional states. Accurate interpretation of these signals provides
caregivers and producers with valuable information regarding animal welfare and may
guide interventions to reduce stress [156].
Cattle exhibit a strong herding instinct; isolation from conspecifics triggers stress
and fear, whereas excessive stocking density can promote somatic disease. Cows employ
a diverse set of postural and acoustic signals [238]. Affiliative interactions, such as al-
logrooming and bodily rubbing occur most frequently between individuals of comparable
hierarchical status. Four major categories of cattle vocalisations have been described, each
associated with distinct emotional states; modulation of vocal features facilitates functions
including social coordination and alarm calling during pasture movement [184,239]. Estrus
in cows is marked by characteristic behavioural patterns, including increased locomotion,
mounting behaviour, and soliciting contact with other animals. Chronic stress arising from
inadequate nutrition or restricted social contact may lead to abnormal behaviours such
as reduced lying time, compulsive cross-sucking, licking of pen structures, or excessive
self-grooming [33,240].
In pigs, acoustic and postural cues constitute the dominant communication channels.
Vocalisations occur during foraging, play, and most prominently in threatening situations.
The vocal repertoire includes grunts, squeals, and screams, which vary in frequency and

amplitude. Intense screaming is most commonly observed in piglets competing for access
to teats, whereas sow grunts function as contact calls that summon piglets during nurs-
ing [239]. Piglets also grunt during play, signalling positive arousal. Tail posture is an
important welfare indicator: tail rigid extension in European breeds often denotes pain or
illness. Changes in body posture play critical roles in hierarchy formation and can signal
aggression, submission, or attempts to withdraw [156,241].
Sheep are highly gregarious and exhibit strong flocking behaviour, including synchro-
nised feeding, resting, and movement. Leadership within the group is typically assumed
by the oldest ewe, whereas among rams the dominant individual is usually the strongest.
Agonistic behaviours include butting, pushing, and visual standoffs. Acoustic cues are
central to sheep communication: low-frequency bleats from ewes facilitate mother–lamb
contact, and rams produce characteristic rutting calls during the breeding season [242].
Sheep are sensitive to disruptions in visual contact, which may result in behavioural
and neuroendocrine dysregulation [239]. Their sensory capabilities include sophisticated
olfactory perception and enhanced auditory sensitivity compared to humans [243].
In goats, social hierarchy correlates strongly with age, with older females typically
occupying higher positions. Tactile communication plays a significant role—individuals
often rest close together, lick each other, engage in nibbling of the coat, and participate in
muzzle-to-body contact. Vibrato-like bleating indicates anxiety, while loud, repetitive bleats
function as contact calls to offspring. Sneezing serves as an alarm signal. Snorting and
tongue-flicking are common in sexual contexts and accompany behaviours such as biting,
butting, and tail grasping [244]. During the breeding season, strong odours arise from the
activity of peri-anal glands combined with increased urination frequency. Environmental
deficiencies—poor housing, inadequate milking systems, low-quality feed—can promote
behavioural abnormalities including aggression and butting [239,245,246].
Alpaca herds are organised around a social hierarchy; males engage in dominance
contests involving body elevation, spitting, pushing, and biting of limbs and the neck.
Such confrontations may result in significant injuries, including testicular damage lead-
ing to reproductive exclusion. A male that abandons the contest typically crouches and
retreats with its head lowered [247]. The principal acoustic signal is a soft humming vo-
calisation, whereas neigh-like calls, warning snorts, and high-pitched squeals indicate
a threat [239,248]. Spitting functions as a mechanism of social control within the group.
Disruptions of communication may result from isolation, inadequate housing conditions,
or premature weaning [249].
Donkeys communicate using acoustic, visual, olfactory, and postural signals. Olfactory
recognition plays a pivotal role in mother–foal bonding. Ear posture is an important
emotional indicator: interested donkeys hold the ears upright with eyes widely opened,
whereas relaxed individuals display lateral ear positioning, a lowered lower lip, and a
horizontally aligned neck. Agitated donkeys flatten the ears, lower the neck, and deliver
sidekicks [239,250]. Vocalisations occur more frequently in males than in jennies or geldings.
Impaired communication is most commonly associated with isolation, improper nutrition,
inadequate husbandry conditions, or premature weaning [251].
Chickens possess a highly complex acoustic communication system. Short, rapid calls
warn of aerial or terrestrial predators. Broody hens produce numerous vocalisations of
varying pitch and frequency that guide chick behaviour [239,252,253].
Horses form hierarchical herd structures, and visual perception constitutes their pri-
mary mode of communication. They possess a panoramic visual field of approximately
350◦, with binocular vision of around 65◦[254]. Acoustic communication enables long-
distance contact, expression of arousal, and mother–foal interactions. Tactile communi-
cation strengthens social bonds; the lips, tongue, and muzzle are particularly sensitive.

Olfactory cues facilitate territorial marking and play an essential role in social relation-
ships [17].
Vocalisations constitute a fundamental component of communication in livestock
species, serving to signal emotional states, physiological needs, and socially relevant
information. In production environments, where direct behavioural observation may be
limited, acoustic analysis provides valuable insights into animal welfare and stress. Table 3
synthesises the principal types of vocalisations observed across major livestock species
and interprets their behavioural and emotional significance. This overview highlights the
diagnostic potential of acoustic signals for assessing animal condition and for improving
husbandry practices.

4. Multimodality and Practical Applications (Welfare, Training, ACI/PLF)
Animal communication is inherently multimodal: visual, acoustic, tactile, and chemi-
cal signals are combined into integrated packages designed to increase detectability, en-
hance robustness against noise, and improve interpretive clarity. Theoretical frameworks
emphasise that these modalities may (1) complement one another by providing redundancy,
(2) carry distinct informational content, thereby offering complementarity, or (3) be flexibly
selected depending on the receiver’s attentional state, the social context, and environ-
mental conditions. Methodological challenges remain, including the distinction between
genuinely multimodal signals and multi-element but single-channel displays, as well as
the development of unified measurement standards allowing meaningful cross-species
comparisons [255,256]. Empirical work provides clear evidence of multimodal signalling;
for instance, greeting rituals of African savannah elephants integrate coordinated visual
and tactile gestures with vocal elements (rumbles, trumpets). Modality choice depends
strongly on the receiver’s attentional orientation: when the receiver is visually attentive,
visual signals dominate; in its absence, tactile and acoustic cues become more frequent. This
phenomenon represents a compelling example of audience design in mammalian commu-
nication [257]. Domesticated species with high social sensitivity, such as dogs and horses,
exhibit cross-modal integration during the recognition of human emotions. Consistency
in valence between facial expressions and vocal prosody enhances interpretive accuracy,
suggesting that integrative mechanisms promote signal reliability under conditions of
sensory noise [258].
In practice, animal training when based on clear, multimodal cues and appropriate
reinforcement can function as a form of environmental enrichment. Training facilitates the
use of other enrichment elements, modifies social interactions, and broadens the animal’s
repertoire of adaptive behaviours, thereby contributing meaningfully to welfare. A pre-
requisite for effective training is the design of communicative cues that are cross-modally
consistent and tailored to the species’ perceptual capacities [259].
The growing relevance of Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI; in agriculture also
HACI–human/animal–computer interaction) and Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) stems
from their ability to integrate multiple data streams–vision, sound, accelerometry, environ-

mental sensors–to enable continuous monitoring of behaviour and welfare. Reviews indi-
cate that coupling ACI/PLF with artificial intelligence can support personalised husbandry
and increase animal agency through interactive systems that facilitate access to resources
(e.g., self-initiated positive stimuli, microclimate selection). However, challenges remain
in relation to scalability, data ethics, and alignment with practical farm constraints [260].
In cattle-monitoring systems, combining visual gait analysis with accelerometry, feeding-
time metrics, activity patterns, or thermal imaging improves the detection of lameness
and allows intervention before pain intensifies or production losses occur. Despite rapid
progress, translational barriers include calibration across farms and algorithmic stability
under variable environmental conditions. In poultry production, multisensor systems
evaluate movement patterns, changes in vocalisation, and environmental parameters, en-
abling early detection of stress and health issues [261]. Smart-farming technologies can
meaningfully improve welfare only when the monitored indicators are designed around the
needs of the animals rather than solely around production efficiency. Essential prerequisites
include field validation of welfare-relevant indicators, transparency of decision algorithms,
and the use of collected data to generate tangible improvements in husbandry conditions
(e.g., microclimate optimisation, noise reduction, behavioural interventions). Only such
an approach allows multimodal ACI/PLF systems to be implemented ethically and in a
manner aligned with the biological and behavioural needs of animals [262].
Practical Implication
Understanding the mechanisms of animal communication has not only theoretical
value but also clear practical relevance for improving welfare, enhancing training effective-
ness, and advancing technologies that support human–animal relationships. Recognising
that signals are inherently multimodal and emotionally grounded enables the design of
more empathetic and effective interactions that align with animals’ natural perceptual
capacities as well as with the constraints imposed by domestication and environmental
conditions. Research on multimodal communication demonstrates that animals much
like humans integrate visual, acoustic, tactile, and chemical cues into coherent social rep-
resentations, thereby increasing signal recognition accuracy and reducing the likelihood
of misinterpretation [255,263]. In practical terms, this means that training and everyday
handling should rely on consistent cross-modal cues, such as the simultaneous use of
gestures, vocal tone, and eye contact. Training based on clear, predictable, and concor-
dant communicative signals reduces stress, shortens learning time, and strengthens the
human–animal bond [259]. Applied ethology increasingly emphasises that training should
be regarded not only as a utilitarian tool but also as a form of environmental enrichment.
Numerous studies show that training grounded in positive reinforcement and transparent
contingencies lowers physiological indicators of stress (e.g., cortisol, heart rate variability),
enhances exploratory and affiliative behaviours, and improves the quality of cooperation
between animals and humans [97,264]. Communication thus functions simultaneously as a
medium for behavioural guidance and as a mechanism for establishing trust and emotional
well-being.
In parallel, technologies enabling objective monitoring of emotions and health are
developing rapidly. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) systems and Animal–Computer
Interaction (ACI) interfaces integrate data from video, acoustic analyses, thermography,
accelerometry, and environmental sensors to create digital models of behaviour and wel-
fare [260,265]. Analyses of vocalisations, facial expressions, or movement patterns allow
early detection of pain, stress, metabolic disorders, or lameness [261,266]. When designed
from the animal’s perspective, these systems can support genuinely personalised care,

identifying individual needs and preferences rather than assessing animals solely through
the lens of production metrics [267].
A central challenge concerns the ethical orientation of technological development.
Neethirajan et al. [260] emphasises that the future of sustainable animal production depends
on combining artificial intelligence with principles of ethology and the neurobiology of
emotions. Monitoring systems should be engineered to respond to indicators of stress or
discomfort in ways that mirror the actions of an empathetic caregiver. The Human–Animal–
Computer Interaction (HACI) framework similarly proposes that animals become active
users of technology, capable of initiating contact, selecting preferred stimuli, or modulating
environmental features [268]. This perspective reframes technology as a facilitator of
animal agency rather than an instrument of control. At the level of individual relationships,
research on the oxytocin–gaze loop in dogs [226] and on emotional mimicry and referential
behaviours [227] demonstrates that interspecies communication relies on mutual emotional
attunement. In training, therapy, and caregiving contexts, humans can leverage these co-
evolved mechanisms to interpret signals more accurately, reduce problematic behaviours,
and enhance animals’ sense of safety.
Integrating ethological research, the neurobiology of emotion, and multimodal signal
analysis leads to a model of communication characterised not as a one-way transmission
but as a bidirectional dialogue. Practically, this implies the need to design environments,
training methods, and technological systems that respect animals’ natural communicative
repertoires, meet their emotional and cognitive needs, and support their welfare.
To synthesise the practical consequences of multimodal communication in mammals,
Table 4 outlines the key domains in which signal integration and advances in ACI/PLF tech-
nologies influence welfare, training, and management systems. The summary highlights
both the biological foundations of communication and their applications in husbandry,
behavioural therapy, and human–animal interaction contexts.

5. Conclusions
Communication in mammals is a complex process that integrates biological, emotional,
and social mechanisms. Although its primary role is information transfer, communication
also regulates social relationships, maintains group cohesion, and enables behavioural
adaptation. Most species employ multiple communicative channels: visual, acoustic, tactile,
and chemical in a multimodal manner, which increases signal robustness and interpretative
clarity.
Neurobiological evidence shows that emotional communication relies on homologous
brain structures across mammals, and the ability to perceive emotional cues is evolutionarily
conserved. In domesticated species, long-term coevolution with humans has further refined
these skills, shaping both the form and function of communicative signals. Domestication
has enhanced sensitivity to human social cues but, in some cases, selective breeding has
constrained expressive capacities.
A systemic perspective integrating social context, emotional processes, environmental
conditions, and evolutionary history is essential for understanding animal communica-
tion. Such an approach has practical implications for training, welfare assessment, and
environmental enrichment. Emerging technologies, including Precision Livestock Farming
(PLF) and Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI), enable objective, real-time monitoring of
behaviour, stress, and health by combining multimodal data streams.
Ultimately, communication forms the foundation of mammalian social life. Recog-
nising and respecting these processes is key to ethical human–animal interactions. Future
research should continue to integrate ethology, neurobiology, and digital technologies to
support and enhance communication in ways that improve both animal welfare and the
quality of human–animal relationships.
