ABSTRACT
The Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop (AVEC 2019)
“State-of-Mind, Detecting Depression with AI, and Cross-cultural
Aﬀect Recognition” is the ninth competition event aimed at the
comparison of multimedia processing and machine learning meth-
ods for automatic audiovisual health and emotion analysis, with
all participants competing strictly under the same conditions. The
goal of the Challenge is to provide a common benchmark test set
for multimodal information processing and to bring together the
health and emotion recognition communities, as well as the audio-
visual processing communities, to compare the relative merits of
various approaches to health and emotion recognition from real-
life data. This paper presents the major novelties introduced this
year, the challenge guidelines, the data used, and the performance

INTRODUCTION
The Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop (AVEC 2019)
is the ninth competition aimed at comparison of multimedia pro-
cessing and machine learning methods for automatic audio, visual,
and audiovisual health and emotion sensing, with all participants
competing strictly under the same conditions [48–50, 62, 63, 72, 74,
75].

F. Ringeval et al.
One of the goals of the AVEC series is to bring together multiple
communities from diﬀerent disciplines, in particular, the audiovi-
sual multimedia communities and those in the psychological and
social sciences who study expressive behaviour. Another objective
is to advance health and emotion recognition systems by providing
a common benchmark test set for multimodal information process-
ing, in order to compare the relative merits of the approaches to
automatic health and emotion analysis under well-deﬁned condi-
tions, i. e. , with large volumes of un-segmented, non-prototypical
and non-preselected data of wholly naturalistic behaviour. This
is precisely the type of data that the new generation of aﬀect-
oriented multimedia and human-machine/human-robot communi-
cation interfaces have to face in the real world.
Major novelties are introduced for the AVEC 2019 with three
separated Sub-challenges focusing on health and emotion analy-
sis: (i) State-of-Mind Sub-challenge (SoMS), (ii) Detecting Depres-
sion with AI Sub-challenge (DDS), and (iii) Cross-cultural Emotion
Sub-challenge (CES). In the following, we describe the novelties in-
troduced in the Challenge and the guidelines for participating.
The State-of-Mind Sub-challenge (SoMS) is a new task focus-
ing on the continuous adaptation of human state-of-mind (SOM),
which is pivotal for mental functioning and behaviour regula-
tion [25]. SOM is constantly shifting due to internal and external
stimuli, and frequent use of either adaptive or maladaptive SOM
inﬂuences our mental health. One key aspect of the human expe-
rience is the way emotion features in our SOM [64, 68]. In the
SoMS, self-reported mood (10-point Likert scale) after the narra-
tive of personal stories (two positive and two negative), has to be
predicted automatically from the audiovisual recordings of those
stories; USoM corpus [46].
The Detecting Depression with AI Sub-challenge (DDS) is a ma-
jor extension of the AVEC 2016 DSC [73], where the level of depres-
sion severity (PHQ-8 questionnaire) was assessed from audiovisual
recordings of patients interacting with a virtual agent conducting a
clinical interview and driven by a human as a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ);
DAIC-WOZ corpus [23]. The DAIC data set contains new record-
ings of the same population with the virtual agent being, this time,
wholly driven by AI, i. e. , without any human intervention. Those
new recordings are used as a test partition for the DDS, and will
help to understand how the absence of a human conducting the vir-
tual agent impacts on automatic depression severity assessment.
The Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge (CES) is a large ex-
tension of the AVEC 2018 CES [47], where dimensions of emo-
tion were inferred from audiovisual recordings collected “in-the-
wild”, i. e. , with standard webcams and at home/work place. A
cross-cultural setup was further exploited for inferring emotion:
knowledge of German culture was leveraged to infer emotion on
the Hungarian culture, using the SEWA corpus [31]. This dataset
now includes data collected from new participants with Chinese
culture, which is used as a test set for the CES, whose aim is, there-
fore, to investigate how emotion knowledge of Western European
cultures (German, Hungarian) can be transferred to the Chinese
culture.
All Sub-challenges allow contributors to ﬁnd their own fea-
tures to use with their own machine learning algorithm. In addi-
tion, standard feature sets are provided for audio and video data
(cf. Section 4), along with scripts available in a public repository1,
which participants are free to use for reproducing both the base-
line features and recognition systems (cf. Section 5). The labels of
the test partition remain unknown to the participants, and partici-
pants have to stick to the deﬁnition of training, development, and
test partition. They may freely report on results obtained on the de-
velopment partition, but are limited to ﬁve trials per Sub-challenge
in submitting their results on the test partition.
Ranking of the labels relies on the Concordance Correlation Coef-
ﬁcient (CCC)[36] for all Sub-challenges; the Root Mean Squared Er-
ror (RMSE) is additionally reported. Whereas many other metrics
of performance could be exploited for ranking the contributions,
such as the Spearman’s CC, or the coeﬃcient of determination (r2),
we believe that the index of reproducibility CCC is the most suit-
able metric to use, as it is not biased by changes in scale and lo-
cation, and elegantly includes information on both precision and
accuracy in a single statistical measure [36]. Moreover, its theoret-
ical deﬁnition and properties are well rooted in the literature [41],
and it can be easily exploited as a loss function for training neural
networks [77].
To be eligible to participate in the Challenge, every entry has to
be accompanied by a paper submitted to the AVEC 2019 Data Chal-
lenge and Workshop, describing the results and the methods that
created them. These papers undergo peer-review by the technical
program committee. Only contributions with a relevant accepted
paper and at least a submission of test results are eligible for partic-
ipation. The organisers do not participate in the Challenge them-
selves, but re-evaluate the ﬁndings of the best performing system
of each Sub-challenge.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. We sum-
marise relevant related work in Section 2, introduce the Challenge
corpora in Section 3, the common audiovisual baseline feature sets
in Section 4, and the developed baseline recognition systems with
the obtained results in Section 5, before concluding in Section 6.

RELATED WORK
This section is a summary of the current state-of-the-art in the
automatic analysis of aﬀect with a focus on: (i) human state-of-
mind, (ii) depression assessment in the context of AI-driven virtual
agents, and (iii) dimensional analysis in cross-cultural paradigms.
2.1
State-of-Mind
The concept of a human SOM describes the phenomenon that our
consciousness and emotions are constantly ﬂuctuating over time;
this is due to internal and external biological, psychological, and
social demands [25, 46]. One key aspect of SOM is our emotions.
They provide valuable information that inﬂuences our basic hu-
man processes in a bidirectional manner [67, 68]. Such processes
include attention, perception, cognition, memory retrieval, mem-
ory storage, and behaviour regulation. In fact, depending on our
actual SOM, some emotions, cognitions, and behaviours are more
likely to occur, while others may be suppressed. This eﬀect is the
underlying principle of mood congruence [52, 64].

AVEC 2019: State-of-Mind, Detecting Depression with AI, and Cross-Cultural Aﬀect
AVEC’19, October, 2019, Nice, France
Despite the major impact of SOM on health and social func-
tioning, the quantiﬁcation of current emotional states, with ther-
apy contexts, has its pitfalls. The simplest of these is that it re-
lies heavily on self-reports of emotional states, which are inher-
ently biased [79]. As humans are structurally determined closed
systems, it is not always sound to assume that people who give
the same scores on measurement scales are actually in the same
SOM [38]. Moreover, even within a person, the current rating of
the emotional state is rooted in previous experiences, known as
the adaption level, and therefore is not really accurate in an abso-
lute way [53].
Approaches like Russell’s avoid having to limit the quantiﬁca-
tion to a given language [52]: on his theory of core aﬀect, every in-
stance of emotion can be quantiﬁed on the orthogonal axes arousal
(from sleepy to hyper-aroused) and valence (with the poles nega-
tive and positive). However, raters’ ability to quantify reliably is
still doubtful. One approach to overcoming this is to treat emo-
tional state values as ordinal variables [79]. Another is to comple-
ment self-ratings with expert ratings or physiological recordings.
Each of these methods has its limitations; the mismatch between
diﬀerent emotion assessments is still very much a matter of scien-
tiﬁc discourse [65, 66].
Despite the given limitations of the scientiﬁc assessment of emo-
tional states, humans constantly monitor their own and others’
emotions and organise themselves within social systems [12, 55].
Given the need for humans to socially interact and the increased
occurrence of human-machine-interactions, the development of a
real-time SOM data-driven recognition system has the potential to
enhance user experience, user satisfaction, and subsequently to fos-
ter user adherence [5, 45, 46]. Such a system could assist society in
various ways; i) decreasing bias in the monitoring of SOM; ii) col-
lecting more objective data to aid the diagnosis of aﬀective disor-
ders; iii) delivering tailored interventions to facilitate treatment of
disease; iv) reducing the time spent in the evaluation of treatment
outcome, and in e-treatment by presenting SOM related content,
easing burdens on both patient and provider [45, 46, 61, 70].
2.2
Depression Detection with AI
Depression, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD), is a
common mental health problem, with negative impacts on the way
one thinks, feels, and acts [3]. It can lead to a variety of emotional
and physical problems and aﬀect many aspects of both working
and personal life. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared
depression as the leading cause of ill health and disability world-
wide in 2015: more than 300 million people live with it [40]. Given
the high prevalence of depression and its suicide risk, ﬁnding new
methods for diagnosis and treatment becomes more and more crit-
ical.
There is growing interest in using automatic human behaviour
analysis for computer-aided depression diagnosis based on be-
havioural cues such as facial expressions and speech prosody, be-
cause of convincing evidences that depression and related men-
tal health disorders are associated with changes in patterns of be-
haviour [8, 11, 28, 58, 78]. Facial activity, gesturing, head move-
ments and expressivity are among behavioural signals that are
strongly correlated with depression.
Early paralinguistic investigations into depressed speech found
that patients consistently demonstrated prosodic speech abnormal-
ities such as reduced pitch, reduced pitch range, slower speaking
rate, and higher articulation errors [11]. Facial expression and head
gestures that can be tracked by computer vision are also good pre-
dictors of depression; e. g., a more downward angle of the gaze, less
intense smiles, and shorter average duration of smiles have been
reported as the most salient facial cues of depression [57]. Further,
body expressions, gestures, head movements, and linguistic cues
have also been reported to provide relevant cues for depression
detection [1, 39, 43, 44].
Taking all those evidences together, it has been proposed to in-
tegrate aﬀective computing technology into a computer agent that
interviews people and identiﬁes verbal and nonverbal indicators of
mental illnesses [14]. Data collected with subjects suﬀering from
post-traumatic stress disorder showed that the automatic evalua-
tion of their level of depression severity (PHQ-8 questionnaire) can
achieve a RMSE less than 5 when the agent is driven by a human
acting as a WoZ [22]; PHQ-8’s range ∈[0, 24] and cutpoints are de-
ﬁned at [5, 10, 15, 20] for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and se-
vere depression, respectively. Those results need to be investigated
further, with the agent being wholly driven by AI, as the wizard
might drive the virtual agent to a situation that eases the obser-
vation of patterns associated with depression, or the autonomous
agent might have issues in conducting the interview appropriately.
2.3
Cross-cultural Emotion Recognition
Cross-cultural emotion recognition has long been highlighted as
an open research question within the aﬀective computing commu-
nity [15, 17, 18, 42], and was introduced as an AVEC Sub-challenge
in 2018 [47]. Whereas the AVEC 2018 CES focused on detecting
arousal, valence, and liking from Hungarian speakers using only
German speakers for training and development of the models [47],
in this year’s AVEC CES the test cohort is Chinese speakers with
speakers from the two cultures mentioned earlier being available
for training, development, and additional testing.
A common belief in facial expression recognition is that emo-
tional expressions have a large degree of universality across cul-
tures [10, 16]. This statement was on the whole supported by both
baseline results and works submitted to the AVEC 2018 CES, with
either vision-only or multimodal systems achieving higher cross-
culture accuracies than speech-only approaches [27, 49, 76, 82].
These results were insightful, as previously, there were only a few
works in the aﬀective computing literature which supported this
claim [9, 15].
Interestingly, approaches in the AVEC 2018 CES did not em-
ploy approaches such as transfer learning [80, 81] or domain adap-
tation techniques [29, 54] typically seen in cross-cultural test-
ing. In [76], the authors proposed a model based on emotional
salient detection to identify emotion markers invariant to socio-
cultural context. The other two entrants employed data driven ap-
proaches based on long short-term memory recurrent neural net-
works (LSTM-RNN) [27, 82]. Matching with similar results in the
literature [21, 56], all entrants in the AVEC 2018 CES observed
a drop in system performance when testing on the Hungarian
data [27, 76, 82].

CHALLENGE CORPORA
The AVEC 2019 Challenge relies on three corpora: (i) the USoM
corpus [46] for the SoMS, (ii) the Extended-DAIC corpus [23] for
the DDS, and (iii) the SEWA dataset [31] for the CES. We provide
below a short overview of each dataset and refer the reader to the
original work for a more complete description.
3.1
Ulm State-of-Mind Corpus
The Ulm state of mind database was collected to assess the asso-
ciation between personal story telling and current SOM, opera-
tionalised by aﬀective state according to Russel’s theory [46, 52,
61]. Parts of this dataset have been released for the Interspeech
2018 Computational Paralinguistics (ComParE) challenge [61].
Participants of the USoM corpus were instructed to ﬁrst tell two
negative personal narratives N N1,2 and subsequently two positive
personal narratives PN1,2, each for ﬁve minutes in front of a cam-
era. They were also asked to rate their current aﬀect (CA) on a 10-
point likert scale for the dimensions arousal and valence before and
after telling each narrative, resulting in the following protocol: (t0),
CA0, N N1, (t1), CA1, N N2, (t2), CA2, PN1, (t3), CA3, PN2, and (t4),
CA4. For the purpose of the Challenge, the USoM dataset was par-
titioned into training, development, and test sets while preserving
the overall speaker diversity – in terms of age, gender distribution,
and core aﬀect evaluations – within the partitions. Table 1 shows
the number of subjects and duration for each partition.
As the interest of the SoMS is on the change in mood, rather
than just its static observation, the initial self-reports made before
the storytelling are included in the data package given to partici-
pants for all partitions, including the test set. Exploiting such con-
textual information in an automatic system predicting the level of
mood is a realistic scenario in the real-world, because a therapist
would always ask a person’s baseline emotion at the start of a ses-
sion. It is thus essential to provide machine learning algorithms
with the same prior information as a therapist would have.
3.2
Distress Analysis Interview Corpus
The Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (E-DAIC) [14] is
an extended version of WOZ-DAIC [23] that contains semi-clinical
interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological dis-
tress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic
stress disorder. These interviews were collected as part of a large
eﬀort to create a computer agent that interviews people and iden-
tiﬁes verbal and nonverbal indicators of mental illnesses [23].
Data collected include audio and video recordings, automati-
cally transcribed text using Google Cloud’s speech recognition ser-
vice, and extensive questionnaire responses. The interviews are
conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie. In the
WoZ interviews, the virtual agent is controlled by a human inter-
viewer (wizard) in another room, whereas in the AI interviews, the
agent acts in a fully autonomous way using diﬀerent automated
perception and behaviour generation modules.
For the purpose of the Challenge, the E-DAIC dataset was par-
titioned into training, development, and test sets while preserving
the overall speaker diversity – in terms of age, gender distribution,
and the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) scores –
within the partitions. Whereas the training and development sets

Table 2.
3.3
Cross-cultural Emotion Database (SEWA)
The SEWA database consists of audiovisual recordings of spon-
taneous behaviour of participants captured using an in-the-wild
recording paradigm [31]. Pairs of friends or relatives from Ger-
man, Hungarian, and Chinese cultures were recorded through a
dedicated video chat platform which utilised participants’ own –
standard – web-cameras and microphones. After watching a set of
commercials, pairs of participants were given the task of discussing
the last advert watched (a video clip advertising a water tap) for up
to three minutes. The aim of this discussion was to elicit further re-
actions and opinions about the advert and the product advertised.
The video chats of the three cultures have been annotated w. r. t.
the emotional dimensions arousal and valence, and a third dimen-
sion describing liking (or sentiment), independently by several na-
tive speakers; German and Chinese: six annotators, Hungarian:
ﬁve annotators. The annotation contours (traces) are combined

into a single gold-standard using the same evaluator weighted esti-
mator (EWE)-based approach that was used in the last two editions
of AVEC [47, 51]. Table 3 shows the number of subjects and the du-
ration of the recordings for each partition.

BASELINE FEATURES
Emotion recognition from audiovisual signals usually relies on fea-
ture sets whose extraction is based on expertise gained over several
decades of research in the domains of speech processing, e. g., Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCCs), and vision computing,
e. g., Facial Action Units (FAUs). However, recent advances in the
ﬁeld of representation learning, whose objective is to learn repre-
sentations of data that are best suited for the recognition task [6],
have shown that eﬃcient representations of audiovisual signals
can be learnt in the context of emotion [2, 59, 71].
Audiovisual representations can be learnt from expert-driven
information extracted from the raw signals [59], or directly from
the raw signals [71]. They can also be generated using adversar-
ial networks [13], or using convolutional neural networks trained
on out-of-domain data and for a diﬀerent task, e. g. , audio repre-
sentations extracted by a model trained for object classiﬁcation in
images [2].
4.1
Expert-knowledge
The traditional approach in aﬀect sensing consists in summaris-
ing low-level descriptors (LLDs) of audiovisual signals over time
with a set of statistical measures computed over a ﬁxed-duration
sliding analysis window. Those descriptors usually include spec-
tral, cepstral, prosodic, and voice quality information for the audio
channel, and appearance, geometric, and FAUs information for the
video channel.
As audio features, we compute the extended Geneva Minimal-
istic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) [19], which contains 88
measures covering the aforementioned acoustic dimensions, and
used here as baseline. In addition, MFCCs 1-13, including their 1st-
and 2nd-order derivatives (deltas and double-deltas) are computed
as a set of acoustic LLDs, using the openSMILE2 [20] toolkit. As vi-
sual features, we extract the intensities of 17 FAUs for each video
frame, along with a conﬁdence measure, using the toolkit open-
Face3 [4]. Descriptors of pose and gaze are additionally extracted.
Audiovisual LLDs are summarised over time by computing their
mean and standard-deviation using a sliding window of 4 s length,
and a hop size of 1 s for the USoM and E-DAIC datasets, and 100 ms
for the SEWA dataset, excepted for the eGeMAPS set, which is com-
puted on each window.
4.2
Bags-of-Words
The technique of bags-of-words (BoW), which originates from text
processing, represents the distribution of LLDs according to a dic-
tionary learnt from them. As a front-end of the BoW, we use the
MFCCs and the eGeMAPS set for the acoustic data, and the inten-
sities of the FAUs for the video data; MFCCs and eGeMAPS LLDs
are standardised (zero mean, unit variance) in an on-line approach
2http://audeering.com/technology/opensmile/
3https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/
prior to vector quantisation, while this step is not required for the
FAU intensities.
To generate the BoW representations, both the acoustic and the
visual features are processed and summarised over a block of a 4 s
length duration, for each step of 100 ms for the SEWA dataset, and
1 s for the USoM and E-DAIC datasets. The codebook size is 100.
Instances are sampled at random to build the dictionary, and the
logarithm is taken from resulting term frequencies in order to com-
press their range. The whole cross-modal BoW (XBoW) processing
chain is executed using the open-source toolkit openXBOW4 [60].
4.3
Deep Representations
As in last year’s challenge [47], we have included Deep Spectrum5
features as a deep learning based audio baseline feature represen-
tation [2]. Deep Spectrum features are inspired by deep represen-
tation learning paradigms common in image processing: spectral
images of speech instances are fed into pre-trained image recogni-
tion CNNs and a set of the resulting activations are extracted as
feature vectors.
For this year’s challenge, we extracted Deep Spectrum fea-
tures from four robust pre-trained CNNs using VGG-16 [69],
AlexNet [34], DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201 [26]; AlexNet
was used in the AVEC 2019 CES purely for consistency with the
previous AVEC 2018 CES. The speech ﬁles are ﬁrst transformed
into mel-spectrogram images with 128 mel-frequency bands, a win-
dow width of 4 s for all challenge corpora and a hop size of 1 s for
the USoM and E-DAIC datasets, and 100 ms for the SEWA dataset.
Following that, the spectral-based images are forwarded through
the pre-trained networks. A 4 096-dimensional feature vector is
then formed from the activations of the second fully connected
layer in VGG-16 and AlexNet, and a 1 024 and a 1 920-dimensional
feature vector is obtained from the activations of the last average
pooling layer of the DenseNet-121 and DenseNet-201 networks,
respectively.
We also provide two baseline deep visual representations. For
these, we employed a VGG-16 [69] network and a ResNet-50 net-
work [24] that are pre-trained with the Aﬀwild dataset [30]. The
pipeline starts with applying the openFace toolkit [4] to detect the
face region and subsequently perform face alignment. Then, we
froze the weights of two pre-trained models and fed the aligned
face images to both CNNs individually. To obtain the deep repre-
sentations for each frame, we extract the output of the ﬁrst fully-
connected layer from the pre-trained VGG-16 network, and the
output of the global average pooling layer from the pre-trained
ResNet-50 network, respectively. As a result, a 4 096-dimensional
deep feature vector from VGG and a 2 048-dimensional deep fea-
ture vector from ResNet are provided for each frame.

BASELINE SYSTEMS
All baseline systems rely exclusively on existing open-source ma-
chine learning toolkits to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

performance, and the two video representations with the best per-
formance, in addition to the fusion of all audiovisual representa-
tions.
5.1
State-of-Mind Sub-challenge
We use a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network with two layers, each
having 64 nodes for their hidden layers, for each audiovisual rep-
resentation. As a pre-processing step, all input features are nor-
malised to have zero mean and unit variance. Dropout, at a rate of
10 %, is employed during training. The GRU is then followed by a
fully connected neural network that has one hidden layer with 32
nodes, followed by a single linear layer to map to the desired out-
put size of one. Note that a middle-fusion of the audiovisual rep-
resentations is performed by concatenating their respective GRU
outputs.
The model is implemented using a Pytorch framework and is
trained with an Adam optimiser. As previous studies have shown
the beneﬁts of training a network following a curriculum [7, 37],
where instances are gradually presented in increasing level of diﬃ-
culty, we implemented this approach using the following strategy.
First, a uniform distribution of valence labels is obtained by du-
plicating training instances, then, a sub-set of the training set with
only the data instances withCA ∈[2−3]∪[9−10],i. e. , the most pos-
itive and negative storytellings, is ﬁrstly used for training, followed
by a larger sub-set with data instances with CA ∈[2 −4]∪[8 −10],
each for 32 epochs. We then exploited the whole training set un-
til early stopping occurs; once 60 epochs have passed, training is
stopped if there is no improvement within the last 25 epochs.
Because the interest of the SoMS is in the analysis of a change
in human SOM, the network is trained to model the diﬀerence be-
tween the self-reported core aﬀect after each story and before the
ﬁrst story:CAi −CA0,i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Results are reported for each au-
diovisual representation, and for the two training approaches, i. e. ,
with or without curriculum, in Table 4. Whereas the mid-fusion of
all audiovisual representations provides the best result on the de-
velopment set for the two learning approaches, audio descriptors
achieve higher performance on the test set, with the expert-based
eGeMAPS set performing best with curriculum learning.
A summary of the results obtained with either a static (CAi) or
a dynamic (CAi −CA0) view of the self-reported mood used for

training or testing the system is also provided in Table 5. Interest-
ingly, results show that the automatic inference of the self-reported
mood performs much better in a ‘mixed’ scenario, i. e. , training on
the static view (CAi) and evaluating on the change (CAi −CA0)
or vice-versa training on the change and testing on the static label,
compared to a ‘consistent’ approach with both training and testing
performed on the same view, i. e. , either static or dynamic.
This result might stem from emotion data being hierarchically
organised. As such, each self-reported emotion is nested within a
person over a period of time [32]. Because of human’s inability to
assess their own emotions as an absolute value, self-reported emo-
tion can only be interpreted as a current assessment of emotional
diﬀerences in relation to the nearest past. Furthermore, there is
also variance in emotion dynamics between people and not only
within a person [33]. The inter-individual and intra-individual vari-
ance in emotion dynamics are strongly related to one another, but
add both new information to predictions. While the variance be-
tween persons might be best captured in a scenario where ma-
chine learning is applied to raw values, the intra-individual auto-
correlation of emotion, the so-called emotional inertia, is portrayed
in the dynamic evaluation [35]. Therefore, training on static data
and evaluating on dynamic data, such as emotional inertia, might
be the state-of-the-art approach to characterise human SOM.

Detecting Depression Sub-challenge
For the depression detection baseline, we employ a single-layer
64-d GRU as our recurrent network with a dropout regularisation
of rate 20 %, followed by a 64-d fully-connected layer to obtain a
single-value regression score. To handle bias, we convert the PHQ-
8 score labels to ﬂoating point numbers by downscaling with a
factor of 25 prior to training. The network is trained and evaluated
using a CCC loss function and evaluation score, and the RMSE re-
sults are reported using the original PHQ scale. A batch size of 15 is
used consistently, and the learning rate is optimised across diﬀer-
ent feature sets. In order for the data to ﬁt on GPU memory, a max-
imum sequence length has been assigned for the sessions. For the
MFCCs and eGeMAPS LLDs, and the high dimensional deep rep-
resentations like DeepSpectrum, ResNet, and VGG, a maximum se-
quence length of 20 minutes is used. Additionally, for ResNet, VGG,
and Deep Spectrum representations frames are dropped keeping
one out of two, or one out of four frames depending on the dimen-
sionality so that the data can be loaded onto memory. Fusion of
the diﬀerent audiovisual representations is achieved by averaging
their scores.
Baseline results of the DDS are given in Table 6. They show
that, on the development set, the best CCC score from audio fea-
tures was achieved with Deep spectrum (DS-VGG) features, and
the model with ResNet features achieved the best result for visual
features. These results indicate the power of representations learnt
by deep neural networks with a large amount of data when being
used in a diﬀerent context to which they were initially designed,
which is conﬁrmed on the test set with the ResNet visual model
achieving the best result, despite a relatively low CCC.
Fusion of the diﬀerent representations achieves the best result
on the development set, and the RMSE returned on the test set
is slightly better than the one obtained on the DAIC-WoZ dataset
with the AVEC 2017 baseline system [51]; RMSE = 6.37 for AVEC
2019 compared to RMSE = 6.97 for AVEC 2017. However, the base-
line system developed for this year’s Challenge is more complex
– a simple linear regression model vs GRU-RNNs for this year –
, and the corresponding scores should be therefore best regarded
in the light of the best results of the AVEC 2017 Depression Sub-
challenge [22], which was RMSE = 4.99.
On the basis of the results obtained in the automatic sensing
of the level of depression from interactions with the virtual agent,
recognition seems more challenging when the agent is solely AI
driven, than when a human is driving the agent as a WoZ. This ob-
servation opens interesting research questions for designing the
agent in a way that the observation of depression cues can be max-
imised, e. g. , by reinforcement learning, according to the interac-
tion style of the agent.
5.3
Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge
For the baseline system of the CES, we employ a 2-layer LSTM-
RNN (64 / 32 units) as a time-dependent regressor of the three tar-
gets (learnt together) for each representation of the audiovisual
signals, and SVMs – liblinear with L2-L2 dual form of the objec-
tive function – for the late fusion of the predictions. The model is
implemented using the Keras framework. The network is trained
for 50 epochs with the RMSprop optimiser using a dropout rate
of 10 %, and the model providing the highest CCC on the develop-
ment set of the German and Hungarian culture is used to generate
the predictions for the test sets (German, Hungarian, and all clips
of the Chinese culture). Even though the model has three outputs
modelling each dimension, the optimum model for each dimension
is selected separately. The predictions of all test sequences from
each culture are concatenated prior to computing the CCC, whose
opposite is used as loss function for training the networks [71, 77].
In order to perform time-continuous prediction of the emotional
dimensions, audiovisual signals were processed with a sliding win-
dow of 4 s length, which is a compromise to capture enough in-
formation to be used with both static regressors, such as SVMs,
and context-aware regressors, such as RNNs. We utilised frame-
stacking for the SVM-based late fusion of the audiovisual repre-
sentations with either past, or future context.
Baseline results of the CES are given in Table 7. They show
improvements over the performance reported in the previous edi-
tion of the AVEC CES; relative improvement for German is 7.25%
and 8.25% for arousal and valence, respectively, and for Hungar-
ian, 17.3% and 13.3%, respectively. The inclusion of instances of
the Hungarian culture as training and development material, in
addition to those of the German culture, might explain the large
increase in performance for both cultures, as only instances of the

German culture were available for training and development in the
AVEC 2018 CES. In addition, a more recent version of the open-
Face toolkit [4] was exploited, which provided the best results on
the test set for both arousal and valence with FAUs based features.
Those results conﬁrm the common view that facial expressions of
emotion have a large degree of universality across cultures, com-
pared to the vocal expressions, where the acoustic and prosodic
dimensions already play a key role in the oral communication by
serving many grammatical and pragmatic functionalities, e. g. , in
tonal languages like Mandarin, the meaning associated with a syl-
lable depends on its pitch contour. Such language dependent pecu-
liarities make cross-cultural settings highly challenging, especially
when noise comes into play because of the ecological conditions
of study.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduced AVEC 2019 – the sixth combined
open Audio/Visual Emotion and Health assessment challenge. It
comprises three Sub-challenges: i) SoMS, where the level of mood
has to be predicted from positive and negative personal stories; ii)
DDS, where the level of depression (PHQ-8 score) has to be pre-
dicted from structured interviews conducted by a virtual agent
wholly driven by AI; and, iii) CES, where the level of aﬀective
dimensions of arousal, valence, and liking has to be inferred in a
cross-cultural in-the-wild paradigm with German and Hungarian
cultures as training and testing material, and Chinese culture as
solely testing material.
By intention, we opted to use exclusively open-source software
and the highest possible transparency and realism for the baselines,
by using the same number of trials as given to participants for
reporting results on the test partition, and sharing all the devel-
oped scripts for both features extraction and machine learning on
a public platform. Results indicate that: i) in the SoMS, the level
of mood was best predicted when the system was trained on the
static scores and evaluated on their dynamic view, i. e. , between
the label provided after the storytellings, and before the ﬁrst story,
which can be explained by inertial emotion theories; ii) in the
DDS, prediction of the level of depression (PHQ-8) is reported to
be more challenging when the virtual agent conducting the inter-
view is wholly driven by AI, compared to a WoZ setup; and iii),
in the CES, dimensional emotions are more challenging to sense
in a cross-cultural setting for audio descriptors compared to video
descriptors, which conﬁrm on one hand the universality of facial
expressions for Asian (Chinese) and Western European cultures
(German and Hungarian), and show on the other the challenge of
using audio descriptors for paralinguistics analysis in languages
presenting dissimilarities in their acoustic, in particular when data
are collected in an ecological (noisy) environment.
