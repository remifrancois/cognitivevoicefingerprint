Abstract
Background
There are no reliable and validated objective biomarkers for the assessment of depression
severity. We aimed to investigate the association between depression severity and timing-
related speech features using speech recognition technology.
Method
Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), those with bipolar disorder (BP), and
healthy controls (HC) were asked to engage in a non-structured interview with research psy-
chologists. Using automated speech recognition technology, we measured three timing-
related speech features: speech rate, pause time, and response time. The severity of
depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item version
(HAMD-17). We conducted the current study to answer the following questions: 1) Are there
differences in speech features among MDD, BP, and HC? 2) Do speech features correlate
with depression severity? 3) Do changes in speech features correlate with within-subject
changes in depression severity?
Results
We collected 1058 data sets from 241 individuals for the study (97 MDD, 68 BP, and 76
HC). There were significant differences in speech features among groups; depressed
patients showed slower speech rate, longer pause time, and longer response time than HC.
All timing-related speech features showed significant associations with HAMD-17 total
scores. Longitudinal changes in speech rate correlated with changes in HAMD-17 total
scores.

Conclusions
Depressed individuals showed longer response time, longer pause time, and slower speech
rate than healthy individuals, all of which were suggestive of psychomotor retardation. Our
study suggests that speech features could be used as objective biomarkers for the assess-
ment of depression severity.
Introduction
The number of individuals with mental illnesses, such as major depressive disorder (MDD)
and bipolar disorder (BP), is increasing around the world [1]. Globally, 241 million people suf-
fered from MDD in 2017, and it was ranked #3 in years lived with disability (YLD) [2], which
makes it one of our most pressing current health issues. As there are no objective biomarkers
for depressive symptoms, depression severity assessments are based on subjective reports [3].
The gold-standard assessment tools for depressive symptom severity are the Hamilton Depres-
sion Rating Scale (HAMD) [4, 5] and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
[6]. These rating scales require raters to have a large amount of training and experience [3, 7].
Moreover, these rating scales cannot be completely objective, and they may lead to a systematic
bias (e.g., an inflation of the baseline scores due to pressures by study sponsors to accelerate
patient enrollment) [7]. To overcome these limitations, objective biomarkers that reflect
depression severity are warranted. Because typical depressed individuals speak in a low voice,
slowly, hesitatingly, and monotonously [8], researchers have tried to quantify these speech fea-
tures to assess the severity of depression [9, 10]. Many initial studies in the 1970s and 1980s,
which used tape recordings and signal processing, reported that depressed individuals showed
slower speech rates and longer pause time than healthy individuals [11, 12]. However, acoustic
signal processing technology available at the time was not adequate to cross-validate the sub-
jective observations [7]. Since the early 2000s, technology for eliciting and analyzing speech
samples has advanced, and been further refined and validated in the literature [7]. Canizzaro
et al. found that a reduced speaking rate had a significant correlation with HAMD scores [13].
Also, Mundt et al. found that depressed individuals who responded to antidepressant treat-
ments showed significantly faster speech rates and shorter pause time after the treatments,
while non-responders did not show significant changes in speech [7, 14]. Although these pre-
vious studies showed the usefulness of timing-related speech features for the assessment of
depression severity, most studies collected speech data from a small sample using a structured
or semi-structured interview. Such methods may not be directly applicable to daily clinical set-
tings. On the other hand, this study was conducted in real-world clinical settings with non-
structured interviews using automated speech recognition technology, which has the potential
for more practical clinical use. We hypothesized: 1) patients with depression speak slower,
pause longer, and respond slower than healthy people; 2) the severity of depression is nega-
tively correlated with speech rate, and is positively correlated with pause time and response
time; 3) As the depression symptoms become less severe in the individual, speech rate becomes
faster, and pause time and response time become shorter.

Patients who met the criteria for MDD or BP according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), were included. This research was done as part
of a larger project called The Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry
Technology (PROMPT). The concept and design of PROMPT is reported elsewhere [15].
PROMPT protocols have been registered with the University Hospital Medical Information
Network (UMIN) (UMIN ID: UMIN000023764). This study was approved by the ethics com-
mittees of Keio University Hospital and other participating facilities, and performed in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
Data collection
Speech data was collected through 10-minute, non-structured interviews with a research psy-
chiatrist or psychologist. During the interviews, participants talked about non-specific topics
such as their everyday lives, disease symptoms, hobbies, etc., and participants were assessed for
depressive symptoms using the HAMD 17-item version (HAMD-17) [5]. Interviews were con-
ducted up to 10 times for each participant, and each interview was conducted at least a week
apart for both inpatients and outpatients. For outpatients, each outpatient clinic conducted the
interview when patients visited the clinic.
Interviews were conducted in a quiet room. For each interview, a participant and an inter-
viewer were seated face to face across a desk. Two array microphones (Classis RM 30 and RM
30 W, made by Beyerdynamic) were placed facing the participant and interviewer, and the dis-
tance between the microphones and the interviewer/interviewee was adjusted to be between
approximately 40 cm and 70 cm. Each microphone was connected to an audio interface
(Roland, model number: UA—55), and its recorded data were converted into a separated wav
file format (PC: Mouse Computer, Inc., model number: NG-N-i 3500 PA 3, OS: Windows 10).
We analyzed these audio files using Ami Voice (Advanced Media, Inc.), which is a speech rec-
ognition software. The speech data from the recordings were segmented into utterance parts
based on the time annotations containing speech time and utterance numbers.
We extracted three timing-related speech features from each speech sample: speech rate,
pause time, and response time. Speech rate was defined as the number of words per minute,
which was calculated by dividing the participant’s total number of words by the participant’s
total speech time during a 10-minute period. Pause time was defined as the interval duration
between the end of a participant’s speech segment and the beginning of the participant’s next
segment. Response time was defined as the mean pause duration between the end of the inter-
viewer’s utterance and the start of an utterance by the participant. Overlapping voice frames
were excluded so that back-channel utterances would not confound response time
calculations.
Statistical analyses
We used IBM SPSS Statistics 24 for statistical analyses and excluded data if it was more than
1.5the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile or below the first quartile. Distribu-
tions of all variables were inspected using histograms, q-q plots, and Shapiro-Wilk tests.
Because response time and pause time were positively skewed, these variables were natural
log-transformed to obtain a normal distribution. First, we conducted analyses of covariance
(ANCOVA), including speech rate, response time, and pause time as dependent variables, to
examine differences among the three study groups (MDD, BP, and HC). Age, sex, and defined
daily doses (DDD) [16], which is to account for the potential effect of medications on speech-
related measures, were included as covariates. Second, we conducted multiple linear regression

analyses to examine the relationships between HAMD-17 scores and each timing-related
speech feature with age, sex, and DDD included as covariates. We used the data sets with the
highest HAMD-17 scores for each patient with MDD or BP in these analyses. In the current
study, we set YMRS > = 8 and HAMD-17 > = 8 as manic and depressive state respectively.
We also conducted the same regression analyses after excluding BP patients with YMRS higher
than 8 and when patients were divided into MDD and BP respectively (S1 File). As additional
analyses, we conducted Spearman correlation analyses to examine the relationship between
the item 8 of HAMD-17 (psychomotor retardation) and each timing-related speech feature for
patients with MDD or BP. Finally, we conducted multiple linear regression analyses to investi-
gate the association between within-subject change in timing-related speech features and
change in HAMD-17 scores (highest HAMD-17 scores—lowest HAMD-17 scores). Interval
between interview days varies from participant to participant. Therefore, age, sex, and interval
between interview days were included as covariates. Statistical significance was defined by a p-
value of <0.05 (two-tailed). Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons correc-
tion. Raw p values are reported in the Results section.
Results
Clinical characteristics
During the period from May 2016 to February 2019, we collected 1058 speech data sets from
241 participants (479 from 97 patients with MDD, 295 from 68 patients with BP, and 284 from
76 HC). Of these speech data sets, 85 speech samples were not recorded properly due to issues
such as inadequate microphone settings and the loss of speech data or rating data. Thus, the
remaining 972 speech data sets from 84 patients with MDD, 68 patients with BP, and 71 HC
were used in the analyses. Table 1 represents the participants’ demographics. There were sig-
nificant differences in mean age among groups (F2,220 = 14.8, p <0.001). HC were significantly
older than patients with MDD (p <0.001) and patients with BP (p = 0.003).
Group comparisons among MDD, BP, and HC
ANCOVA revealed significant differences between study groups in speech rates (F2,216 = 6.48,
p = 0.002), pause time (F2,199 = 5.99, p = 0.003), and response time (F2,197 = 9.89, p <0.001)
(Fig 1). Patients with MDD had slower speech rates (p = 0.001), longer pause time (p = 0.002),
and longer response time (p = 0.001) than HC. Moreover, patients with MDD showed longer
response time (p = 0.001) than patients with BP, but there were no significant differences in
speech rate (p = 0.498) and pause time (p = 0.314).

There were no significant differences in any speech features between patients with BP and
HC.
Association between HAMD-17 scores and timing-related speech features
There were significant partial correlations between HAMD-17 scores and speech rate
(r = –0.378, df = 147, p <0.001), pause time (r = 0.298, df = 130, p = 0.001), and response time
(r = 0.458, df = 135, p <0.001) (Fig 2).
There were still significant partial correlations between HAMD-17 scores and these timing-
related speech features after excluding BP patients with YMRS higher than 8 and when patients
were divided into MDD and BP respectively (S1 File).
In addition, there were significant correlations between the item 8 of HAMD-17 (psycho-
motor retardation) and speech rate (Spearman’s ρ = –0.242, df = 151, p = 0.003), pause time
(Spearman’s ρ = 0.206, df = 135, p = 0.017), and response time (Spearman’s ρ = 0.306,
df = 132, p < 0.001).

Association between longitudinal change in HAMD-17 scores and change
in timing-related speech features
There was a significant partial correlation between changes in the total HAMD-17 scores and
changes in the speech rate (r = –0.317, df = 125, p <0.001). Changes in the pause time
(r = 0.207, df = 107, p = 0.033) and changes in the response time (r = 0.207, df = 109,
p = 0.034) were also correlated with changes in the HAMD-17 total scores.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to date that investigated the association
between timing-related speech features and depression severity. We found that speech rate,
pause time, and response time had significant correlation with the severity of depression.
Moreover, longitudinal changes in these timing-related speech features showed association
with longitudinal changes in total HAMD-17 scores. We acquired speech data during non-
structured interviews; therefore, our results may be easier to generalize for application in daily
clinical settings compared to previous studies.
Previous studies about timing-related speech features
Speech rate has been regarded as one of the features that show promise for characterizing
depression. Many initial studies reported that patients with MDD spoke slower than controls
[11, 12, 17]. One study, which used audio tape recordings of seven individuals, reported that
speech rate showed a significant negative correlation with HAMD scores [13]. Another study
found that speech rate became faster after antidepressant treatments for patients with MDD
[14]. Pause time has also been reported to be associated with depression. Previous studies in
the 1970s found that pause time was longer for depressed patients than for controls, and that
pause time correlated with HAMD scores [7, 11–13, 18]. Response time was analyzed in only a
few previous studies [19–21]. Those studies used standard reading tasks or semi-structured
interviews to gather data, and found that response time was longer for depressed patients than
for controls, and that response time became shorter as HAMD scores decreased. Although
these findings are in line with our findings, many previous studies have struggled to separate
the voices of study participants and researchers, as well as to measure the speed and/or timing
of speech. For example, some studies interviewed participants over the telephone to collect
voice data [7, 14], while others had participants read fixed-form sentences in order to extract
only the participant’s voice [12]. Regarding the measurement of speech timing or speed, some
previous studies used an oscilloscope and a cine camera to measure the length of the utterance
[11, 12], and others semi-automatically detected the occurrence of an utterance or silence
using software which could not automatically detect syllables [13, 20]. Such methodological
limitations made it difficult to assess large datasets. In the current study, by using array micro-
phones and automatic speech recognition technology, we automatically obtained the timing-
related speech data in real-world clinical settings from larger datasets.
Association with psychomotor retardation
In his 1921 book, Kraepelin wrote about speech characteristics in depressed individuals:
“patients speak in a low voice, slowly, hesitatingly, monotonously, sometimes stuttering, whis-
pering, try several times before they bring out a word, become mute in the middle of a sen-
tence. They become silent, monosyllabic, can no longer converse.” These speech
characteristics are now considered to be aspects of psychomotor retardation, which is regarded
as one of the prominent features of depression [22]. Assessment of psychomotor disturbances

may have tremendous value for clinicians because psychomotor retardation can be a predictor
for clinical response to electroconvulsive therapy and medications [23–25]. Therefore, an
accurate and objective measurement of patient’s psychomotor retardation could contribute to
the improvement of the classification of depression, longitudinal monitoring, and prediction
of outcomes in patients with depression.
For now, there are three major scales for psychomotor retardation currently available: the
Salpetriere Retardation Rating Scale (SRRS) [26], the Motor Agitation and Retardation Scale
[27], and the CORE measure [28]. However, these scales are completely dependent on the sub-
jective judgement of clinicians. In the present study, by using speech recognition technology,
we were able to measure patient’s speech features in clinical settings easily and objectively. In
these ways, timing-related speech features, such as speech rate, pause time, and response time,
could be utilized as objective biomarkers for psychomotor retardation. As additional analyses,
we investigated the relationship between HAMD-17 psychomotor retardation score and
speech features and there were significant correlations between them. It would be beneficial in
the future to investigate if these speech features are correlated with more detailed psychomotor
retardation assessment like the CORE measure.
The process of speech production involves simultaneous cognitive planning and complex
motoric muscular actions [3], so both cognitive and motor impairments can influence the pro-
cess of speech production. Meanwhile, the neurobiological process underlying the inhibition
of activity includes functional deficits in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia [22]. Structural
imaging studies suggest that patients with depression have frontostriatal abnormalities, such as
deep white matter lesions, and decreased volumes of the prefrontal cortex, the caudate nucleus,
and the putamen [28–30]. These deficits may be more profound in the presence of psychomo-
tor retardation [22]. The prefrontal cortex plays a fundamental role in working memory [31,
32], which is important to manipulate information and perform complex cognitive tasks for
speech production. In addition, the basal ganglia form a major center in the complex extrapy-
ramidal motor system. The striatum receives inputs from all cortical areas and, through the
thalamus, projects signals principally to the frontal lobe areas, which are concerned with
motor planning [33, 34]. Given this evidence, speech disturbances in patients with psychomo-
tor retardation might be caused by functional deficits in the prefrontal cortex and the basal
ganglia. As discussed above, timing-related speech features could reflect the status of neurolog-
ical functions in patients with depression. This discussion is only speculative, however, future
studies should investigate the relationship between speech disturbances and these neurobio-
logical functional deficits, which may possibly lead to uncovering the pathophysiology of
depression or developing better treatments.
Limitations
Some limitations should be acknowledged. First, speech features may be influenced by the per-
sonality or speech habits of each participant. However, the results of our within-subject longi-
tudinal analyses also suggest that speech features reflect depression severity. Second, in the
current study, healthy participants were significantly older than patients with MDD or BP.
However, we included age in the analyses as covariates and, despite the fact that older people
generally speak more slowly than younger people [35], our results showed that speech rates
were still faster in healthy controls than patients with MDD. Third, noises in the examination
room may have disrupted the accuracy of the automatic speech recognition technology,
although the interviews were conducted in a quiet room of the hospital. Finally, some side
effects of drugs, such as sleepiness, might be related to timing-related speech features. We did

not investigate detailed side effect profile in the current study to explore these complex
correlations.
In conclusion, depressed individuals demonstrated a slower speech rate, longer response
time, and longer pause time compared to healthy controls. Moreover, changes in these timing-
related measurements were associated with depressive improvement. Our results suggest that
timing-related speech features could be used as noninvasive, easy-to-use digital biomarkers for
the assessment of depression severity.
