Abstract Human
beings
have
co-evolved
with
the
microorganisms in our environment for millions of years,
and have developed into a symbiosis in a mutually beneﬁ-
cial/defensive way. Human beings have signiﬁcant multi-
faceted relationships with the diverse microbial community.
Apart from the important protective role of microbial
community exposure in development of early immunity,
millions of inimitable bacterial genes of the diverse micro-
bial community are the indispensable source of essential
nutrients like essential amino acids and essential fatty acids
for human body. The essential nutrition from microbiome is
harvested through xenophagy. As an immune effector,
xenophagy will capture any microorganisms that touch the
epithelial cells of our gastrointestinal tract, degrade them
and turn them into nutrients for the use of our body.

We are greatly interested in the paper by Gupta et al. [1]
which depicts the important protective role of microbial
community exposure in development of early immunity, and
humans’ signiﬁcant relationships with diverse microbial
community. In accordance with this opinion, we would like
to go a step further to propose that the millions of inim-
itable bacterial genes of the diverse microbial community [1]
are the indispensable source of essential nutrients like
essential amino acids and essential fatty acids for our body.
Myriads of microorganisms exist in our environment
and tens of trillions of microorganisms live in our human
body [2–4], and they play a crucial role in the health of
food-deriving plants and animals [5, 6], and in human
immunity, health and wellness [3, 4, 7]. Research shows
that gut dysbiosis is corelated with numerous diseases like
infectious diseases, gastrointestinal malignancy, obesity,
diabetes, liver diseases, allergies, and more [3, 4, 8, 9].
Microbiome-targeting personalized medicine using probi-
otics for therapeutic purpose are developed in recent years
[3, 4, 8, 10].
Microbiome themselves are also essential to the nutri-
tion balance of our body. The human microbiota contain
100 times more genes than that found in the entire human
genome [9, 10]. These genes are the indispensable source
of essential nutrients like essential amino acids and
essential fatty acids for human body. The microbial com-
munity in our colon works as the microbiomes in the rumen
of cattle [11, 12]. The microbiome transform the chemical
constituents of plant/animal-sourced raw food materials
into bio-available nutrients by fermentation [13]. For
example, the microbiota breakdown cellulose of the plant
cell wall, the contents of the cell are released and acces-
sible to our digestive enzyme [14]. The fermentation pro-
duces short chain fatty acid that our body can absorb and
use as carbon source for organic compound synthesis. The
microbiome synthesize amino acids for protein for their
own need from non-protein nitrogen present in our food
[11, 12]. While cattle can do the microbial fermentation in
their stomach, we human beings can prepare the fermented

food and eat it in raw to get the beneﬁt from microbiomes
[13, 15–17].
The amino acids from microbiome is harvested through
autophagy (xenophagy) [18–21], not by conventional
absorption. Although the microbiome in our gastrointesti-
nal tract (GIT) help us in digestion of foods, they are
potential pathogens if they have the chance to invade into
the interior of our body. So, besides food digestion and
absorption, our GIT mucosa has another very important
role as barrier to these microbiome [22]. As an immune
effector, autophagy will capture any bacteria, viruses and
fungi that touched our epithelial cells of our GIT, degrade
them and turn them into amino acids for the use of our
body [18, 23–29]. In fact, autophagy not only helps our
immune system in defending pathogen invasion, but also
provides extra nutrition to our body by degrading the
microbiome in our GIT.
Research shows that saprophagous insects mostly feed
on microbiota growing on dead organic matter rather than
the organic matter itself, and the dietary microbiota enhance
the hosts’ resistance against parasitoid attacks [30].
Research also show that gut microbiome of insects affects
no only the metabolism, immune status of the insects, but
also the foraging behavior and nutrient ingestion of the host
insects [31]. These ﬁndings clearly show that, with the help
of xenophagy, microbiota are the main source of essential
nutrients for the host, and any non-microbiome foods are
largely the raw materials for the microbiota to live on.
Lacking of microbes in our food or inside our human body
will result in adverse effect to our nutrition balance and
health.
In conclusion, the right and diverse gut microbiome
community is the factory and direct source of many fun-
damental building blocks for our body. There is no way
around it. There are no any supplements in replacing
microbiome for our essential nutrition needs.
