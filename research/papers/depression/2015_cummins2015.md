## Abstract

<h4>Background</h4>The field of speech emotion recognition (SER) encompasses a wide variety of approaches, with artificial intelligence technologies providing improvements in recent years. In the domain of mental health, the links between individuals' emotional states and pathological diagnoses are of particular interest.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the performance of tools combining SER and artificial intelligence approaches with a view to their use within clinical contexts and to determine the extent to which SER technologies have already been applied within clinical contexts.<h4>Methods</h4>The review includes studies applied to speech (audio) signals for a select set of pathologies or disorders and only includes those studies that evaluate diagnostic performance using machine learning performance metrics or statistical correlation measures. The PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and ScienceDirect databases were queried as recently as February 2025. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to measure the risk of bias.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 14 articles were included in the final review. The included papers addressed suicide risk (3/14, 21%), depression (8/14, 57%), and psychotic disorders (3/14, 21%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>SER technologies are mostly used indirectly in mental health research and in a wide variety of ways, including different architectures, datasets, and pathologies. This diversity makes a direct assessment of the technology challenging. Nonetheless, promising results are obtained in various studies that attempt to diagnose patients based on either indirect or direct results from SER models. These results highlight the potential for this technology to be used within a clinical setting. Future work should focus on how clinicians can use these technologies collaboratively.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD420251006669; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251006669.
