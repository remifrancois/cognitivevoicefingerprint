Mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and borderline personality 
disorder (BPD), are common, often begin early, and can cause profound impairment. 
Traditional assessments rely heavily on subjective reports and clinical observation, 
which can be inconsistent and biased. Recent advances in AI offer a promising 
complement by analyzing objective, observable cues from speech, language, facial 
expressions, physiological signals, and digital behavior. Explainable AI ensures 
these patterns remain interpretable and clinically meaningful. A synthesis of 24 
recent systematic and scoping reviews shows that depression is linked to self-
focused negative language, slowed and monotonous speech, reduced facial 
expressivity, disrupted sleep and activity, and altered phone or online behavior. 
Anxiety disorders present with negative language bias, monotone speech with 
pauses, physiological hyperarousal, and avoidance-related behaviors. BPD exhibits 
more complex patterns, including impersonal or externally focused language, 
speech dysregulation, paradoxical facial expressions, autonomic dysregulation, 
and socially ambivalent behaviors. Some cues, like reduced heart rate variability 
and flattened speech, appear across conditions, suggesting shared transdiagnostic 
mechanisms, while BPD’s interpersonal and emotional ambivalence stands out. 
These findings highlight the potential of observable, digitally measurable cues 
to complement traditional assessments, enabling earlier detection, ongoing 
monitoring, and more personalized interventions in psychiatry.

1 Introduction
Mental health disorders such as mood disorders (e.g., depression), anxiety disorders and 
borderline personality disorder (BPD) are among the most prevalent and disabling conditions 
worldwide. They often begin in adolescence or early adulthood, are highly comorbid, cause 
serious functional impairment, and carry an elevated mortality risk (Polanczyk et al., 2015; 
Solmi et al., 2022). Despite growing research, reliable detection and effective treatment of these 
conditions remain challenging. Psychiatric assessments rely predominantly on subjective 
methods such as self-report, clinical interviews, and clinician observation, which are variable,

and prone to bias (Zimmerman, 2024; Newson et al., 2020). Structured 
interviews exist but are underutilized, especially in non-specialist 
settings, potentially missing subclinical or atypical cases (Allsopp et 
al., 2019). The absence of objective biomarkers further limits 
diagnostic precision (Pratt and Hall, 2018), compounded by the 
heterogeneity within diagnostic categories—for example, there are 227 
possible ways to meet the symptom criteria for major depressive 
disorder (Zimmerman et al., 2015).
Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly in fields like 
oncology, radiology, and dermatology, by analyzing standardized, 
image-based data (Zhou et al., 2025; Hosny et al., 2018; Behara et al., 
2024). Psychiatry, in contrast, has been slower to adopt AI due to the 
subjectivity of symptoms, diagnostic heterogeneity, and ethical 
concerns surrounding sensitive psychological data (Lee et al., 2021). 
Nonetheless, AI shows promise for early detection, risk stratification, 
and personalized mental health care (Baydili et al., 2025).
AI enables the integration of large-scale, multimodal data, 
including behavioral, linguistic, and physiological signals, to uncover 
complex, non-linear patterns beyond human perception (Chen X. et 
al., 2024). For example, AI can predict depression severity from speech 
and facial expressions (Sadeghi et al., 2024). These tools can detect 
subtle mental health indicators and improve diagnostic accuracy and 
timing (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023).
To be clinically viable, AI must be interpretable. Explainable AI 
(XAI) addresses this need by prioritizing transparency and 
accountability, making algorithmic outputs understandable to both 
clinicians and patients (Amann et al., 2020).
Observable cues offer a foundation for XAI. These objective 
behavioral and physiological indicators, captured via smartphones, 
wearables, or webcams, include speech features, facial expressions, 
language use, nonverbal behaviors, heart rate variability, and digital 
activity patterns (Sheikh et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2025; Smrke et al., 
2024). Although we use the term “objective” throughout, it refers to 
the raw data being captured independently of human perceptual bias 
(unlike self-reports or clinician ratings) (Zimmerman, 2024; Newson 
et al., 2020). Downstream machine-learning processing (e.g., facial 
emotion recognition models) can nevertheless introduce algorithmic 
biases related to training data demographics or representation, 
(Aquino, 2023; Shahbazi et al., 2023) a point we return to in the 
limitations section. Multimodal integration of such cues reflect 
spontaneous, ecologically valid behavior, aligning with the principles 
of digital phenotyping (Moura et al., 2023; König et al., 2022).
Empirical findings support the clinical relevance of these cues. 
Remote assessments combining audiovisual and physiological data 
have demonstrated high accuracy in identifying symptoms of 
depression and anxiety (Merritt and Zak, 2024; Chen J. et al., 2024). 
Language-based features, such as excessive self-referential pronouns 
and negative emotion words, correlate with depression and suicidal 
ideation (Trifu et al., 2024). Smartphone-derived behavioral metrics 
including call frequency and screen time, predict mood instability and 
psychosocial stress (Tng and Yang, 2024; Brodersen et al., 2022).
This review synthesizes findings from scoping reviews, systematic 
reviews, and meta-analyses on multimodal, objectively measurable 
cues across mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and BPD. Its unique 
contribution lies in providing the first synthesis to explicitly map both 
the clinical feasibility and the passive-sensing potential of these 
multimodal cues across the three disorder groups—an integration not 
achieved in prior single-cue or single-disorder reviews. In addition, 
we examine the methodological, ethical, and explainable-AI 
implications of using such cues in clinical practice. By combining 
these perspectives, we highlight the translational potential of validated 
multimodal digital biomarkers to support transparent AI systems that 
enable earlier detection, personalized intervention, and ethically 
responsible psychiatric care.
2 Methods
2.1 Overview
We conducted a scoping review following Arksey and O’Malley 
(2005) and Levac et al. (2010). Accordingly, we: (1) formulated the 
research questions, (2) identified relevant literature, (3) selected 
studies for inclusion, (4) charted key data, and (5) synthesized and 
reported the findings. To ensure a transparent and systematic process, 
we adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines (Tricco et al., 2018), as illustrated in Figure 1.
2.2 Identifying the research question
Our investigation was guided by two primary research questions: 
(RQ1) What observable cues of borderline personality disorder, mood 
disorders, or anxiety disorders are reported in existing review articles? 
and (RQ2) Which observable cues are shared across these disorders, 
and which ones are distinct enough to differentiate among them?
We focused on objectively measurable, spontaneously expressed 
indicators, including language, speech, facial expressions, nonverbal 
behavior, physiological signals, and other behavioral metrics. To guide 
this investigation, we established specific inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, which are explained in the following section.
2.3 Identifying relevant studies
Searches were performed in Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, 
the two leading citation bases that include a vast collection of articles 
from diverse databases such as MEDLINE and ProQuest (Zhu and 
Liu, 2020). In WoS, we excluded preprint articles and put no constraint 
on year of publishing. After refining our search to create the most 
optimal search string, we conducted the main search on December 10, 
2024. We used the following final search string in both databases to 
identify relevant studies: (“borderline personality disorder” OR 
“emotionally unstable personality disorder” OR “emotional intensity 
disorder” OR “mood disorder*” OR “affective disorder*” OR 
“depressive disorder*” OR depression OR MDD OR dysthymi* OR 
“anxiety disorder*” OR GAD OR PTSD OR C-PTSD OR CPTSD OR 
“posttraumatic stress disorder” OR “post traumatic stress disorder” 
OR “panic disorder” OR “social phobi*”) AND (“digital indicator*” 
OR “physiological indicator*” OR “digital indices” OR “physiological

“respiratory sinus arrythmia” OR “blood pressure” OR “corrected Qt” 
OR Qtc OR “blood volume pulse” OR “cardiovascular reactivity” OR 
“pupillary response” OR “blink rate” OR “pupil dilation” OR 
pupillometry OR “pupil size variation” OR “eye movement

(review OR “meta analysis” OR meta-analysis OR metaanalysis OR 
“meta-review”) NOT (“autonomic hyperact*” OR Alzheimer* OR 
Parkinson* OR hyperactivation OR “sympathetic hyperactivity” OR 
depressor OR “cutaneous depression” OR “respiratory depression” OR 
“synaptic depression” OR “potentiation/depression” OR dementia OR 
autism OR autistic OR “neurological disorder” OR stroke OR 
Huntington* OR paralysis OR mutism OR “multiple sclerosis” OR 
“cerebral palsy” OR “Down syndrome” OR mouse OR mice OR rat* 
OR rodent* OR “speech disorder” OR “language disorder” OR “visual 
impairment”). Our search terms by category are presented in Table 1.
To be considered for inclusion, articles had to: (1) be a scoping, 
systematic review, or meta-analysis; (2) focus primarily on objectively 
measurable observable cues in borderline personality disorder, mood 
disorders, or anxiety disorders; and (3) be written in English.
Articles were excluded if they: (1) included clinical populations 
outside the target disorders, (2) did not feature objectively measurable 
cues, (3) relied predominantly on non-clinically accessible equipment 
(e.g., MRI, CT, EEG, facial EMG), (4) examined only task- or stimulus-
induced responses, or (5) proposed cues without grounding in 
experimentally tested theory.
Methodological quality was not an exclusion criterion.
2.4 Study selection
The main search resulted in 4,216 English-language records 
(Scopus: 2,970, Web of Science: 1,246) from peer-reviewed articles and 
conference proceedings. To expand the coverage, a supplementary 
search within Google Scholar was conducted, adding one additional 
qualified article. After removing 484 duplicate records, 3,733 unique 
articles were screened. At title and abstract screening, 224 articles 
(6.0% of unique records) seemed to satisfy inclusion criteria. 
Following full-text assessment, only 24 articles (0.6% of unique 
records) met full inclusion criteria and were included in the final 
synthesis. This substantial attrition reflects both a deliberately broad 
search string designed to capture diverse cue types and the application 
of rigorous, transparently reported exclusion criteria to ensure clinical

relevance and feasibility. Consistent with PRISMA-ScR guidelines 
(Tricco et al., 2018) which make critical appraisal optional for scoping 
reviews, we did not conduct formal risk-of-bias or quality assessment 
of the 24 included reviews, as our goal was to map the breadth of the 
literature and the source articles were already high-level syntheses.
2.5 Charting the data
Based on the research questions, we made a structured spreadsheet 
to guide data extraction from the included reviews. The following 
information was recorded: (1) authors, (2) year of publication, (3) type 
of article, (4) number of primary studies covered, (5) reported 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, (6) disorders relevant to our scope, 
(7) observed cues categorized by type and disorder, (8) methods of 
observation, and (9) limitations noted by the authors. Data were 
extracted independently by four researchers (GM, AR, ŽS, and SM) 
and refined through an iterative process during the review.
2.6 Collating, summarizing, and reporting 
results
We adhered to the goal of scoping reviews, i.e., the charting of 
current evidence and its descriptive representation (Arksey and 
O’Malley, 2005). After extraction of data by GM, AR, ŽS, and SM, data 
were subsequently subject to thematic analysis by authors GM, AR, 
and SM. Cue categories were predefined and covered: (1) language, (2) 
speech, (3) facial expressions, (4) other nonverbal communication, (5) 
physiological measures, and (6) behavioral cues. Charting and 
summarizing of findings were checked by three researchers (IM, US, 
and SM).
3 Results
3.1 Characteristics of reviewed studies
Of the 24 included articles, 17 were systematic reviews, 6 scoping 
reviews, and 1 without a specified type. The earliest review was 
published in 2018 (Rohani et al., 2018) and the most recent in 2024 
(Smrke et al., 2024; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024; 
Liu et al., 2024; Močnik et al., 2024; Shin and Bae, 2024; Zierer et al., 
2024). On average, reviews included 60 articles (SD = 50), with the 
highest number being 184 (Khoo et al., 2024) and the lowest 9 (Smrke 
et al., 2021). With respect to mental disorders, 21 articles investigated 
observable cues related to mood disorders (20 on depression and 7 on 
bipolar disorder), 10 addressed anxiety disorders, and one examined 
BPD. The observable cues studied were diverse and included language 
(10 studies), speech (10 studies), facial expressions (5 studies), and 
physiological cues (10 studies) measured using various methods such 
as ECG, wristbands, EEG, EMG, Ag/AgCl electrodes, and respiration 
sensors. Other domains of interest were nonverbal communication [1 
study; (Pampouchidou et al., 2019)], phone use (11 studies), mobility

and activity cues (14 studies), sleep (5 studies), and online activity (3 
studies). In many studies, wearable hardware (e.g., mobile phones, 
wristbands) and software (e.g., GPS, calls and texts tracking, Wi-Fi, 
bluetooth, cellular network, accelerometer, actigraphy, audio 
recording) was used to collect observable cues. The full characteristics 
of the reviewed studies are presented in Table 2.
3.2 Observed cues for mood disorders
This section provides an overview of the findings of 21 review 
studies that examined observable or physiologically measurable cues 
of mood disorders, particularly depressive and bipolar disorder.
3.2.1 Cues related to language use
Regarding language use cues in mood disorders, the most 
consistent finding is that people with depression use more first-person 
language and pronouns (Khoo et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Smrke 
et al., 2021; Maatoug et al., 2022). They also express negative emotions 
more frequently (Khoo et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 
2021; Maatoug et al., 2022; Dhelim et al., 2023). In addition, reviews 
report that people with depression use fewer positive emotion words 
(Smrke et al., 2021) and use more death-related words (Choi et al., 
2024; Zierer et al., 2024). One study found that third-person pronouns 
such as “others” are also used more often (Khoo et al., 2024). In terms 
of language structure, depressed patients tend to use more ruminative 
language (Zierer et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021), and more passive 
forms such as auxiliaries (Zierer et al., 2024). Their language is often 
unclear, repetitive, incoherent (Liu et al., 2024), with reduced 
complexity [i.e., fewer complex sentences, less adverbial clauses; 
(Smrke et al., 2021)]. We have also found that depressed individuals 
tend to talk or write less, particularly on social media (Choi et al., 
2024; Smrke et al., 2021), although other studies report mixed results 
(Dhelim et al., 2023). Saccaro et al. (2021) found that depression is 
associated with a higher number of characters in both incoming and 
outgoing text messages, whereas manic states were associated with 
fewer characters in incoming texts. Specific lexical markers of 
depression include words related to pain (Smrke et al., 2021; Dhelim 
et al., 2023), treatment (“side effects” and “therapy”), absolutist 
expressions (e.g., “always,” “never”), past-oriented terms (e.g., 
“learned,” “remember”) (Smrke et al., 2021), words indicating daily life 
stress and calls for support (Dhelim et al., 2023), expressions of low 
self-esteem and pessimism (Liu et al., 2024), and reward-related words 
(Choi et al., 2024). More specific markers include” hurt,” “tears,”” 
alone,” “hate,” “sleep,” and “worry” (Smrke et al., 2021), as well as 
“depressed,” “hopeless,” and “worthless” (Khoo et al., 2024).
3.2.2 Cues related to speech
In terms of speech, the most consistent findings across studies 
are that depressed individuals speak less overall (Shin and Bae, 
2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Zarate et al., 2022). They tend to produce 
shorter phrases and engage less in verbal communication (Smrke 
et al., 2021). Depression is also marked by a slower speech rate (Liu 
et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021), longer pauses during speech 
initiation and conversation (Smrke et al., 2021; Maatoug et al., 
2022; Low et al., 2020), and increased response latency (Liu et al., 
2024; Maatoug et al., 2022). A negative correlation between pitch 
and loudness and the severity of depression has been shown (Liu 
et al., 2024). Several studies consistently report reduced variation 
in pitch and loudness and reduced F0 range, resulting in 
monotonous speech (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021; Low et al., 
2020). Relatedly, less frequently reported cues linked to depression 
include lack of linguistic stress (Smrke et al., 2021). Jitter and 
shimmer are also commonly observed (Smrke et al., 2021; Low et 
al., 2020). In comparisons to healthy controls, manic states have 
been linked to increases in pitch, F1, F2, and F4 values (Saccaro et 
al., 2021; Low et al., 2020), manic patients’ vocal tracts have also 
been shown to produce more distinct or pronounced spectral 
patterns (Saccaro et al., 2021). Depression was also associated with 
unclear articulation (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021). Acoustic 
analyses reveal alternated formant frequencies in F2; decreases in 
depression (Smrke et al., 2021) and increases in mania (Saccaro et 
al., 2021).
3.2.3 Cues related to facial expressions
Studies have consistently found that depression is associated with 
reduced facial expressivity (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021; 
Pampouchidou et al., 2019), particularly with respect to positive 
emotions (Smrke et al., 2021). Relatedly, reduced activation on the 
zygomaticus muscle (activates during smiling) and fewer smiles were 
observed in depressed individuals (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021; 
Pampouchidou et al., 2019). Depression is also linked to reduced 
variability and intensity of facial expressions. Depressed individuals 
more frequently display sad, negative, neutral expressions, and frowns 
(Smrke et al., 2021), which are linked to downward-angled mouth 
corners (for sadness) and extended activity on the corrugator muscle 
[for frowns; (Smrke et al., 2021; Pampouchidou et al., 2019)]. Reduced 
saccadic eye movements and increased visual fixation have also been 
observed in depressed individuals (Smrke et al., 2021), along with 
limited eye contact, which is often shorter or evasive. Glances tend to 
be lower in both frequency and duration (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 
2021; Pampouchidou et al., 2019) and a greater tendency toward 
toward downward gaze has been reported (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et 
al., 2021). Other characteristics include more frequent lip pressing 
(Smrke et al., 2021).
3.2.4 Other cues of nonverbal communication
Only one review has included studies that investigate cues of 
nonverbal communication (Pampouchidou et al., 2019). They found 
that shaking and/or fidgeting behavior, self-adaptors, and foot tapping, 
slumped posture, limp and uniform body posture, reduced and slowed 
arm and hand movements have been considered as signs of depression.
3.2.5 Cues related to physiological measurements
Studies report that depressed individuals show lower heart rate 
variability (HRV) across time and frequency domains, as well as 
reduced inter-beat intervals (Zierer et al., 2024; Maatoug et al., 2022; 
Chesnut et al., 2021), while some studies found a positive relation 
between HRV and depressive symptom severity (Saccaro et al., 2021). 
Depressed patients tend to exhibit higher LF/HF ratios, coupled with 
decreased high-frequency HRV in bipolar disorder (Zierer et al., 2024; 
Maatoug et al., 2022). HRV was found to be increased in manic states 
compared to both depressive and euthymic states (Saccaro et al., 
2021). Regarding blood pressure, one review reported that individuals 
with depressive symptoms exhibit higher average systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure (Shahimi et al., 2022). Furthermore, increased blood

pressure variability has been observed in patients with depressive 
symptoms (Shahimi et al., 2022). Several studies also highlight body 
temperature anomalies in depression. Findings include decreased 
temperature, decreased temperature amplitude, lower skin 
temperature amplitude and less stable skin temperature rhythms, and 
night-time increases in temperature in depressed individuals 
(Maatoug et al., 2022). Less frequently reported are findings on skin 
conductance: depressed individuals exhibit lower tonic skin 
conductance (Chesnut et al., 2021).
3.2.6 Other behavioral cues
3.2.6.1 Mobility and activity
Depression has consistently been associated with reduced 
mobility patterns. Depressed individuals tend to visit fewer 
locations, make fewer exits from home, show lower variance in 
distance travelled, and visit fewer new places. They also spend 
more time at home, have a reduced mobility radius, and show 
lower entropy (a measure of how evenly they spend time across 
clusters of places; low entropy = time spent in visited places is not 
evenly distributed) and location variance (Rohani et al., 2018; 
Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Saccaro et 
al., 2021; Bufano et al., 2023; Hilty et al., 2021; Shin and Bae, 
2023). In contrast, studies report that adolescents with depression 
travelled longer distances compared to healthy controls (Khoo et 
al., 2024) and that depression was not associated with staying 
more time at home (Hilty et al., 2021). For mania, increased 
mobility and greater travel activity have been reported (Bufano et 
al., 2023; Hilty et al., 2021), while one study found that distance 
travelled was negatively associated with mania and the number of 
cell tower changes to be positively associated with mania but 
negatively with depression (Fraccaro et al., 2019). Sheikh et al. 
(2021) have also found mixed findings on association between 
bipolar mania and distance travelled. In individuals at risk for 
bipolar disorder, locomotor amplitude index was found to predict 
future risk (Saccaro et al., 2021). Increased geospatial activity has 
also been linked to improvements in depression scores (Sheikh et 
al., 2021).
Depression was consistently associated with reduced physical 
activity, including fewer daily steps, lower exercise levels, more 
sedentary behavior, less motion variability, and reduced fine 
motor movements (Rohani et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et 
al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Maatoug et al., 2022; Zarate et al., 
2022; Hilty et al., 2021; Bhadra and Kumar, 2022). Some studies 
also show later activity onset, midday activity peaks, and reduced 
evening activity in depressed individuals (Maatoug et al., 2022; 
Saccaro et al., 2021; Hilty et al., 2021). Depression has further 
been linked to lower nearby Bluetooth device count, lower 
variance, and less periodicity (Maatoug et al., 2022; Shin and Bae, 
2023). Decreased physical activity was also found in bipolar 
patients (Saccaro et al., 2021).
3.2.6.2 Sleep and circadian rhythm
In depression, disruptions in sleep and circadian patterns are 
widely observed. Depressed individuals commonly show reduced 
daytime but increased nighttime activity, irregular circadian 
rhythms (Rohani et al., 2018; Zierer et al., 2024), delayed sleep 
phases, greater night-to-night variability, insomnia, poor sleep 
quality, and increased exposure to light at bedtime (Choi et al., 
2024; Zarate et al., 2022). Importantly, sleep architecture and 
motor activity during sleep show substantial heterogeneity: some 
individuals demonstrate markedly reduced nocturnal motor 
activity consistent with hypersomnia, whereas others display 
increased nighttime movement and sleep fragmentation, reflecting 
insomnia and psychomotor restlessness (Rohani et al., 2018; Choi 
et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Zarate et al., 2022). In bipolar 
disorder, patients demonstrate shorter sleep duration, more 
interruptions, and greater variability in day-to-day sleep time 
compared to healthy controls (Saccaro et al., 2021).
3.2.6.3 Phone use
Depression has been associated with greater overall smartphone 
use, more variable use patterns, higher nighttime and evening activity, 
higher screen unlock frequency, longer screen-on times, and shorter 
unlock durations (Rohani et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 
2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Hilty et al., 2021). In bipolar disorder, 
screen-on duration was longer in manic and mixed states compared 
to euthymia (Saccaro et al., 2021). Positive correlations between 
normalized entropy of screen status and depression have also been 
described (Maatoug et al., 2022).
Depression is associated with fewer and shorter calls, fewer 
incoming and answered calls, fewer outgoing calls per day, and fewer 
contacts saved (Khoo et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Maatoug et al., 
2022; Saccaro et al., 2021; Zarate et al., 2022; Hilty et al., 2021). Longer 
outgoing call durations have been linked to depression (Choi et al., 
2024), however (Rohani et al., 2018) reported low agreement of 
studies on association between depression and call duration and call 
frequency. Depressed participants also call fewer individual people 
than controls (Zierer et al., 2024). In mania, individuals tend to make 
longer calls and receive more incoming calls (Maatoug et al., 2022; 
Saccaro et al., 2021; Hilty et al., 2021).
Depressed individuals send more text messages and open 
messaging apps less frequently (Zierer et al., 2024), but receive fewer 
messages (Khoo et al., 2024). Other studies found that depressed 
individuals portrayed reduced SMS frequency (Maatoug et al., 2022; 
Zarate et al., 2022). Rohani et al. (2018) on the other hand found low 
agreement among studies regarding the link between received text 
messages and depression. Same was found with emotionally unstable 
students who exhibited higher texting frequency (Choi et al., 2024). 
Manic states, in contrast, are associated with an increase in messages 
sent (Hilty et al., 2021) compared to depressed states (Saccaro et 
al., 2021).
3.2.6.4 Social media and online activity
Depressed individuals tend to post more frequently at midnight, 
but their posts receive less engagement in the form of likes or retweets 
(Khoo et al., 2024). In addition, posting activity has been negatively 
correlated with depressive symptoms, and depressed individuals tend 
to have fewer Facebook friends, while a marginally positive correlation 
has been found with Instagram use (Khoo et al., 2024; Dhelim et al., 
2023). They also disclose less personal information, are more likely to 
modify images, and are less likely to share location information (Khoo 
et al., 2024). More broadly, depressed individuals used social 
applications more frequently and for a longer duration (Khoo et al., 
2024). Zierer et al. (2024) also found that using social applications in 
the evening is a predictor of depressive symptoms.

3.3 Observed cues for anxiety disorders
This section synthesizes findings from 10 recent systematic and 
scoping reviews examining observable or physiologically measurable 
cues in individuals with anxiety disorders, including generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder 
(SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and related conditions.
3.3.1 Cues related to language use
Language use in individuals with anxiety disorders revealed 
several patterns. Most consistently, individuals with social anxiety 
displayed a negativity bias in language, with increased use of negative 
emotion words, fewer positive emotion words, and a higher 
proportion of death-related terms (Smrke et al., 2024). Ambient 
speech analysis linked GAD to the frequent use of reward-related 
words and SAD to vision-related terms, potentially indicating 
attentional biases toward goals and environmental surveillance (Choi 
et al., 2024).
3.3.2 Cues related to speech
Speech patterns in PTSD and social anxiety showed consistent 
paralinguistic alterations. PTSD patients exhibited longer pauses, 
slower speech rates, and lower vocal intensity, especially during 
trauma recall - features reflective of emotional suppression and 
cognitive overload (Low et al., 2020). A flatter prosody and monotone 
delivery were also associated with higher anxiety levels, pointing to 
disrupted affective modulation in speech (Smrke et al., 2024).
3.3.3 Other cues of nonverbal communication
Across the reviewed literature, no consistent anxiety-specific 
patterns were reported regarding gaze behavior, gestures, posture, or 
nonverbal synchrony.
3.3.4 Cues related to physiological measurements
Physiological dysregulation emerged as the most consistent 
observable cue across anxiety disorders. Reduced HRV and lower 
respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were reported in children with 
anxiety disorders, indicating diminished parasympathetic tone (Ko et 
al., 2024). Elevated 24-h blood pressure and increased blood pressure 
variability were associated with GAD (Shahimi et al., 2022). Shortened 
inhalation/exhalation cycles and irregular respiratory rhythms were 
also markers of heightened anxiety (Smrke et al., 2024). Consistent 
with this, significantly reduced time-domain and high-frequency 
HRV were observed in anxiety populations, reflecting vagal 
withdrawal (Chesnut et al., 2021). PTSD was associated with elevated 
electrodermal activity and higher resting heart rate, indicative of 
increased sympathetic arousal (Hilty et al., 2021).
3.3.5 Other behavioral cues
Several studies linked behavioral patterns with anxiety. Movement 
data revealed that higher mobility diversity and frequent exits from 
home predicted lower social anxiety, while restricted transitions (e.g., 
from education to supermarkets) predicted higher levels (Smrke et al., 
2024). App usage patterns showed that anxious individuals spent more 
time on passive media, gaming, and health-related apps, and behaviors 
like maintaining distance from virtual characters were linked to SAD 
Khoo et al., 2024. Increased digital activity during late hours was 
observed among anxious users (Dhelim et al., 2023). Socially anxious 
individuals demonstrated reduced movement diversity, avoidance of 
darkness, increased phone use, and a pattern of evening calls and 
irregular walking (Choi et al., 2024). Greater time spent at home and 
avoidance of religious venues correlated with higher SAD (Hilty et al., 
2021), and socially anxious students were less engaged in public or 
leisure activities. PTSD patients showed more nighttime activity and 
fragmented sleep patterns (Sheikh et al., 2021).
3.4 Observed cues for borderline 
personality disorder
The scoping review conducted by our research group in 2024 
remains the only systematic effort to date that specifically examines 
observable, AI-detectable cues in individuals with BPD. The review 
categorized observable behaviors and physiological signals into six 
predefined domains: language use, speech characteristics, facial 
expressions, nonverbal communication, physiological measures, and 
other behavioral cues (Močnik et al., 2024).
3.4.1 Cues related to language use
Language use in BPD revealed a distinct stylistic and thematic 
pattern. Most notably, individuals with BPD exhibited a preference for 
impersonal and externalized expressions, with increased use of third-
person singular pronouns (e.g., “they”) and future tense constructions. 
Their 
speech 
frequently 
contained 
negations, 
intensifiers, 
conjunctions, and nonfluencies such as “so,” “I mean,” or “because.” 
Thematic analysis highlighted frequent references to social processes, 
powerlessness, and biomedical narratives, though some texts 
emphasized identity, acceptance, and individuality. Notably, a negative 
emotional tone was more common in written content, while 
interviews revealed more neutral affect. No significant differences 
were observed in sentence complexity or semantic richness when 
compared to controls.
3.4.2 Cues related to speech
Speech in BPD was characterized by elevated pause frequency and 
a slower speech rate, suggesting conversational dysregulation. Dialogue 
dynamics showed distinctive coupling between vocal-acoustic features, 
such as decibels and fundamental frequency, and emotional 
expressions, particularly adjectives and interjections conveying anger 
or disgust. Interestingly, the direction of acoustic-emotion correlations 
(e.g., anger vs. loudness or pitch) differed from those in healthy 
individuals, suggesting altered affective mapping in speech.
3.4.3 Cues related to facial expressions
Facial expressivity in BPD patients fell into two clusters. One 
cluster exhibited high expressivity with intense negative emotions 
like anger, contempt, and disgust, which co-occurred with social 
smiles – indicating mixed or conflicting emotional signaling. The 
other cluster showed less intense negative affect but retained affiliative 
expressions. Compared to controls, individuals with BPD expressed 
less sadness but more disgust and contempt, suggesting a preference 
for externalizing emotional states. Overall, emotional signaling in 
BPD was complex, often blending hostile and affiliative cues. 
Behavioral markers included diminished affiliative gestures such as 
smiling and nodding, which typically support social cohesion. 
Interestingly, individuals with BPD also exhibited persistent social

smiles—possibly signaling an attempt to maintain interpersonal 
engagement despite internal distress. Interactional behavior often 
reflected ambivalence, with simultaneous cues of withdrawal and 
social approach, indicating internal conflict in social contexts.
3.4.4 Other cues of nonverbal communication
Nonverbal behavior in BPD revealed atypical social signaling. 
Patients often led the rhythm of interaction through pseudosynchrony, 
a form of nonverbal synchrony with conversational partners. 
Affiliative gestures such as eyebrow raises and head tilts were less 
frequent, indicating impaired prosocial communication. Flight 
behaviors, signaling withdrawal, were observed in both BPD and 
control participants, implying they may be general rather than 
disorder-specific markers.
3.4.5 Cues related to physiological measurements
Physiological markers in BPD demonstrated signs of autonomic 
dysregulation. While heart rate (HR) findings were inconsistent, 
reduced RSA and HRV were consistently linked to symptom severity. 
Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed at rest, 
along with prolonged QTcd intervals, suggesting altered cardiac 
repolarization. Sympathetic arousal was evidenced by increased skin 
conductance levels (SCL), while lower orbicularis oculi EMG activity 
suggested blunted facial muscle responsiveness.
4 Discussion
This review brings together 24 systematic and scoping reviews 
published between 2018 and 2024 that explored observable, digitally 
measurable cues across three major psychiatric conditions: mood 
disorders (depression and bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders, and 
BPD (Smrke et al., 2024; Rohani et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo 
et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Močnik et al., 2024; Shin 
and Bae, 2024; Zierer et al., 2024). Most studies focused on depression, 
fewer on anxiety, and only one specifically on BPD (Močnik et al., 
2024). Observable cues spanned language and speech, facial 
expressions, nonverbal behaviors, physiological signals, mobility, 
sleep, phone use, and online activity (Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 
2024; Pampouchidou et al., 2019).
In mood disorders, depression consistently presented with self-
focused, negatively valenced language, frequent use of first-person 
pronouns, death-related words, ruminative and passive expressions, 
reduced linguistic complexity, and lower social media activity (Choi 
et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; 
Smrke et al., 2021). Speech patterns included reduced verbal output, 
slower rate, longer pauses, monotonous pitch, and increased jitter 
and shimmer (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021; Maatoug et al., 2022; 
Low et al., 2020). Facial expressions were blunted, with fewer smiles, 
reduced zygomaticus activation, increased frowning, and downward 
gaze (Liu et al., 2024; Smrke et al., 2021; Pampouchidou et al., 2019). 
Physiological changes involved reduced HRV, altered blood pressure, 
and disrupted temperature rhythms (Zierer et al., 2024; Maatoug et 
al., 2022; Chesnut et al., 2021; Shahimi et al., 2022). Behaviorally, 
depressive states were marked by reduced mobility, lower physical 
activity, irregular circadian rhythms, disrupted sleep, and changes in 
phone and online activity (Rohani et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo 
et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Saccaro et al., 2021; Bufano et al., 2023; 
Hilty et al., 2021; Shin and Bae, 2023). In contrast, manic episodes in 
bipolar disorder showed increased mobility, travel distance, phone 
activity, and more variable speech (Saccaro et al., 2021; Bufano et al., 
2023; Hilty et al., 2021).
Anxiety disorders displayed a distinct pattern. Language reflected 
a negativity bias, heightened attentional vigilance, and increased use 
of reward- or vision-related words in GAD and SAD (Smrke et al., 
2024; Choi et al., 2024). Speech was slower, monotone, and punctuated 
by longer pauses, particularly during trauma recall in PTSD (Smrke 
et al., 2024; Low et al., 2020). Physiological markers consistently 
included reduced HRV and RSA, sympathetic overactivation, irregular 
respiratory cycles, and elevated blood pressure (Ko et al., 2024; 
Chesnut et al., 2021; Shahimi et al., 2022; Hilty et al., 2021). 
Behaviorally, anxiety was associated with avoidance of public spaces, 
restricted transitions, increased nighttime activity, and heavier use of 
passive digital media (Sheikh et al., 2021; Choi et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 
2024; Dhelim et al., 2023).
BPD, based on the single scoping review, showed unique and 
often ambivalent cues (Močnik et al., 2024). Language featured 
impersonal pronouns, externalized references, negations, intensifiers, 
and conversational nonfluencies. Speech was slower with more 
frequent pauses and an altered mapping between acoustic features and 
expressed emotions. Facial expressions were paradoxical, combining 
anger, contempt, disgust, and social smiles. Nonverbal communication 
showed reduced affiliative gestures and atypical pseudosynchrony. 
Physiologically, BPD was associated with reduced HRV and RSA, 
elevated blood pressure, prolonged QTc intervals, and increased skin 
conductance. Behaviorally, individuals demonstrated ambivalent 
social approach, diminished prosocial gestures, and persistent social 
smiles despite internal distress.
Across disorders, depression and anxiety share an internalizing 
profile, whereas BPD is characterized by emotional ambivalence and 
dysregulation across linguistic, expressive, physiological, and social 
domains. Shared features like reduced HRV and monotone speech 
suggest transdiagnostic pathways. Overall, cues in mood and anxiety 
disorders align with clinical models, while BPD findings provide 
empirical support for theories of emotional instability and 
interpersonal dysregulation.
Objective cues can complement traditional assessments, support 
early detection, track symptom fluctuations, and guide personalized 
interventions. Clinical integration requires careful attention to privacy, 
ethics, and standardization (Močnik et al., 2024; Bhadra and Kumar, 
2022). Future research should emphasize longitudinal, multimodal 
studies in diverse populations, especially in BPD where data 
remain limited.
4.1 Ecologically valid multimodal 
assessment, digital phenotyping, and 
small-data machine learning
A critical future direction is the development of ecologically valid, 
real-world multimodal systems that capture cue dynamics in daily life. 
A recently proposed trimodal framework integrating ecological 
momentary assessment, physiological measurements, and speech 
emotion recognition to model emotion dynamics longitudinally 
presents a promising blueprint for dynamic multimodal digital 
phenotyping in mental health (Wang et al., 2025).

This approach aligns closely with the broader concept of digital 
phenotyping, which seeks to redefine psychiatric assessment through 
continuous, passive, data-driven monitoring in everyday life (Oudin 
et al., 2023).
Finally, individualized modeling faces the “small-data problem.” 
Few-shot, transfer-learning, and small-data machine learning 
techniques are therefore essential to achieve clinically useful 
personalized models in psychiatry (Koppe et al., 2021).
4.2 Study limitations
Several limitations should be noted. First, the evidence is uneven 
across disorders: most studies have focused on depression and bipolar 
disorder, with fewer addressing anxiety, and only one review 
specifically examining BPD (Smrke et al., 2024; Khoo et al., 2024; 
Močnik et al., 2024). Second, methodological differences across the 
included reviews make synthesis challenging, as studies varied in how 
they collected data (e.g., wearable devices, phone tracking, EEG, 
EMG), the parameters they measured, and the analytic approaches 
they used (Choi et al., 2024; Zierer et al., 2024; Pampouchidou et al., 
2019). Third, many studies were cross-sectional, which limits our 
ability to draw causal conclusions or understand how observable cues 
change over time (Saccaro et al., 2021; Hilty et al., 2021). Fourth, the 
specificity of the markers is limited because some features overlap 
across disorders - for example, reduced HRV and monotonous speech 
appear in depression, anxiety, and BPD (Močnik et al., 2024; Chesnut 
et al., 2021). Finally, most studies focused on adults, which restricts 
how well the findings can be applied to children, adolescents, or 
culturally diverse populations (Khoo et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024).
In addition, we did not conduct a formal critical appraisal of the 
24 included reviews. While permissible within the PRISMA-ScR 
framework (Tricco et al., 2018), the absence of quality assessment 
remains a limitation; future updates may incorporate methodological 
weighting. Most source reviews also did not systematically address key 
confounders, 
including 
psychotropic 
medication, 
somatic 
comorbidity, age, substance use, and physical fitness, which are known 
to influence physiological and behavioral cues (Croatto et al., 2023). 
Medication effects on HRV represent a particularly important source 
of reduced disorder-specificity (Quintana et al., 2016). Lastly, although 
described as “objective,” many digitally measurable cues (e.g., facial 
emotion recognition, speech-based affect classification) depend on 
machine-learning models that may inherit demographic or cultural 
biases from training datasets. These biases warrant caution when 
interpreting findings and considering clinical deployment.
4.3 Clinical implications
Validated multimodal cues offer clear translational value across 
psychiatry. They can complement traditional assessments by providing 
digitally measurable insights into emotional, behavioral, and 
physiological states (Choi et al., 2024; Močnik et al., 2024). In mood 
disorders, shifts in mobility, sleep, or phone activity may signal 
emerging depressive or manic episodes and support longitudinal 
monitoring (Khoo et al., 2024; Hilty et al., 2021). In anxiety disorders, 
reduced HRV and sympathetic overactivation can indicate heightened 
arousal and maladaptive coping (Smrke et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024). For 
BPD, indicators of ambivalent social signaling, emotional dysregulation, 
and physiological hyperarousal may enrich clinical interviews, inform 
risk, and support treatment planning (Močnik et al., 2024). Integrating 
language, speech, facial expressions, physiological data, and digital 
behavior enables more personalized interventions and earlier detection 
while monitoring treatment response. Implementation requires careful 
attention to privacy, data security, ethical standards, and patient consent 
(Močnik et al., 2024; Welzel et al., 2025). Ultimately, multimodal digital 
cues may help differentiate overlapping symptoms and refine 
individualized care across psychiatric disorders (Sahili et al., 2024).
5 Conclusion
Observable, digitally measurable cues provide objective, clinically 
relevant insights across psychiatric disorders. Depression and anxiety 
share overlapping internalizing patterns, whereas BPD is distinguished 
by emotional ambivalence, altered speech-emotion relationships, and 
paradoxical expressions. These markers can enhance assessment, 
monitor symptom trajectories, and guide early, individualized 
interventions. To advance clinical utility, future research should 
prioritize longitudinal, multimodal studies across diverse populations, 
improve marker specificity, and validate predictive models. 
Collectively, these efforts support a more precise, data-informed 
approach to psychiatric care that complements traditional evaluation 
and tailors interventions to individual patient profiles.
