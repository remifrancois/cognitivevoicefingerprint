proportion of Tregs in clBALF than in hlBALF or PB 
(8.5 vs. 5.0 vs. 5.1%, respectively, p < 0.05). The median 
proportion of (in)CTLA-4+ Tregs was higher in clBALF 
than in hlBALF or PB (89.0, 81.5, 56.0%, p < 0.05). IL-17 
concentration was the highest in clBALF—6.6 pg/ml. We 
observed a significant correlation between the proportion 
of Tregs and (in)CTLA-4+ Tregs with IL-17A concentra-
tion in clBALF. We confirmed significant differences in 
the proportion of regulatory elements between cancerous 
lung and healthy lung and PB and the usefulness of BALF 
analysis in evaluation of immune response regulation in 
local lung cancer environment.

Abstract  Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important 
role in the suppression of the immune response in lung 
cancer. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) 
expressed on T lymphocytes is capable of downregulat-
ing cytotoxic T cells and is constitutively expressed on 
Tregs. Little is known about the population of Tregs with 
two forms of CTLA-4: surface (s) and intracellular (in) in 
the lung cancer environment. Th17 cells defined by pro-
duction of IL-17 have pleiotropic functions in anticancer 
immune response. Our aim was to detect the elements of 
immune response regulation in lung cancer in three com-
partments: by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
(BALF) from the lung affected by cancer (clBALF), 
healthy symmetrical lung (hlBALF) and peripheral blood 
(PB) from the same patient. A total of 54 samples were 
collected. Tregs, (s)CTLA-4, (in)CTLA-4 were detected 
by flow cytometry with antibodies against CD4, CD25, 
Foxp3, CD127, CTLA-4, and concentration of IL-17 was 
estimated by ELISA. We observed a significantly higher

Introduction
Lung cancer is still the main oncological problem world-
wide. There are about 1.8 million new cases yearly [1]. 
The prognosis is very poor with <15% of the overall sur-
vival. This cancer is the first cause of cancer deaths among 
patients with malignancy. About 70% of cases are in the 
advanced stages of this disease at the time of diagnosis, 
and these tumors are unresectable [2, 3]. Rapid accurate 
diagnosis, recognition of risk factors and the improve-
ment of treatment efficacy are the main challenges in the 
case of this tumor. Many inhibitory mechanisms of immune 
response have been demonstrated in lung cancer patients in 
circulation and the resected tumor samples being the basis 
of new methods of immunotherapy [4–6]. The investiga-
tions of the possible biomarkers before immunomodulatory 
treatment are ongoing.
The impairment immune surveillance plays an important 
role in the progression of lung cancer. It is well known that 
T regulatory cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in inhibition 
of the immune response [7]. Their function depends on the 
expression of transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) 
[8]. Recently, the presence of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) molecule has been demonstrated as 
a strong inductor of Tregs function [9, 10]. Tregs form a 
subpopulation of T cells, which modulate the immune sys-
tem, maintain tolerance to self-antigens and abrogate auto-
immune diseases. Tregs represent about 5% of circulating 
CD4+ T lymphocytes in the human peripheral blood and 
are defined by the expression of CD4, high expression of 
CD25 and Foxp3 and lack of CD127 [11]. Generally, Tregs 
suppress or downregulate the proliferation and function of 
effector T cells; thus, they may stimulate cancer progres-
sion [12]. An increased number of Tregs has been observed 
in the blood and in the tumor mass of patients with differ-
ent solid tumors [13–15].
CTLA-4 also known as CD152 is a protein receptor 
that downregulates the immune system. CTLA-4 is con-
stitutively expressed on Tregs. However, CTLA-4 can also 
function in the non-Treg compartment being expressed on 
other T cells [16]. CTLA-4 is similar to the T cell co-stim-
ulatory protein, CD28. CTLA-4 and CD28 bind to CD80 
or CD86 on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 transmits 
an inhibitory signal, whereas CD28 transmits an activation 
signal to T cell [17]. CTLA-4 is identified as a surface or 
intracellular antigen. The physiologic regulation causes the 
immediate endocytosis of surface molecule, and the major-
ity of CTLA-4 is localized in intracellular granules [18]. 
Thus, there are two forms of CTLA-4 expression: on the 
cell surface after activation (s), and intracellular as storage 
(in) [19].
The increased proportion of Tregs, high expression of 
Foxp3 and CTLA-4 on tumor infiltrating and peripheral 
blood lymphocytes have been observed in lung cancer [8, 
10, 20]. Yet, little is known about the lung population of 
Tregs with CTLA-4 expression in the lung cancer microen-
vironment and the difference between (s) and (in) CTLA-4 
on Tregs, which may be important for their function.
Th17 cells are defined by production of IL-17 and are 
known to be very plastic cells [21]. Some data show that 
IL-17 may play a dual role in the antitumor immunity [22]. 
IL-17 promotes an antitumor cytotoxic T cell response 
leading to tumor regression. On the other hand, by facili-
tating angiogenesis and egress of tumor cells from the pri-
mary focus, IL-17 promotes tumor spread [23–25].
The recognition of mechanisms of anticancer immune 
response may have important therapeutic implications [26]. 
Knowledge of the defense mechanisms in lung cancer is 
restricted to the studies of peripheral blood (PB), which 
reflects a systemic immune response and to a small num-
ber of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which are 
qualified to resection. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a 
method for investigation of large part of the lung and ena-
bles examination of the local immune response in the lung 
cancer environment. BAL may be performed in all lung 
cancer stages [27]. All these reasons justified the choice of 
the BAL fluid (BALF) analysis as a basic material of this 
research.
The aim of the study was to detect some selected ele-
ments of the regulation of immune response in lung cancer 
based on the examination of BALF from the lung affected 
by cancer (clBALF as the local environment), from the 
healthy lung (hlBALF as a control) and in PB (as the sys-
temic environment) from the same patient. We investigated 
the proportion of Tregs, Tregs with (s) and (in) CTLA-4 
expression and IL-17 concentration in these three compart-
ments, and we evaluated the relations between them.
Patients and methods
Patients
The study group consisted of 18 patients with confirmed 
primary lung cancer; in all patients it was NSCLC. There 
were 6 women and 12 men; mean age 68.4 ± 7.3 years; 
range (min–max) 50–81 years. There were patients in the 
I–III stages of the disease (according to 7th TNM classifi-
cation) [28].
All patients underwent clinical examination, bronchos-
copy with BALF (Department of Surgery, National Institute 
of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Warsaw, Poland) and 
laboratory tests. Patient’s informed consent (the Medical 
University of Warsaw Ethics Committee) was required from 
all patients before each diagnostic procedure. Primary lung 
cancer confirmed by histological examination constituted an

inclusion criterion. Exclusion criteria were as follows: any 
kind of anticancer therapy, signs of infection, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), autoimmune diseases, 
immunosuppressive therapy. Further exclusion criteria were 
established after macro- and microscopic BALF examina-
tions and those were: bloody fluid, <50% of recovered fluid, 
the absence of lymphocytes in the cytological samples in the 
May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) staining and no representa-
tive number of events in flow cytometric analysis of material.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in all patients dur-
ing a routine diagnostic bronchofiberoscopy. During the 
procedure, 100  ml of 0.9% NaCl solution was instilled 
to each lung. BALF was taken from the cancerous lung 
(clBALF) and from the healthy lung (hlBALF) of the same 
patient during the same procedure. The volume of recov-
ery fluid was 50% or more. BALF processing was realized 
according to the recommendations [29]. The material was 
filtered through a nylon gauze, the volume was measured, 
and then the fluid was centrifuged for 10 min (300×g). The 
cell pellet was used for total and differential cell counting 
and for flow cytometry. BALF supernatants were frozen at 
−70 °C and preserved until further processing. The Bürker 
chamber was used to measure the total cell count. Differen-
tial cell count was determined on two MGG-stained slides 
with the use of light microscopy. The rest of the pellets 
were used for cell analysis by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry was used to determine the lymphocyte sub-
types in the clBALF, hlBALF and PB. The numbers of Treg 
subpopulations and Tregs with the presence of CTLA-4 in 
samples were determined by a panel of monoclonal anti-
bodies against: CD4 PE-Cy7, CD25 PE, CD127 BV421, 
Foxp3 Alexa Fluor 488, CTLA-4 APC (BD, USA); Tregs 
were defined as CD4+ CD25highFoxp3+ CD127-cells. The 
amounts of Tregs were presented as a median proportion 
of CD4-positive cells. Two forms of CTLA-4: surface (s) 
and intracellular (in) were analyzed in different tubes. For 
Foxp3 and (in)CTLA-4 detection, membrane permeabili-
zation with Transcription Buffer Set (BD, USA) was used. 
CTLA-4-positive cells were shown as a median proportion 
of Tregs. The samples were processed by the FACS Canto 
II flow cytometer (BD, USA).
Enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The BALF and serum IL-17A concentration was meas-
ured by means of a commercially available kit Quantikine 
ELISA Human IL-17A Immunoassay (R&D System, USA) 
according to the producer’s instruction. The absorbance 
was measured at 450 nm by a Microplate reader (the Stat-
Fox-2100 model; Awarness Technology Inc).
Statistical analysis
The Statistica 12.0 software (StatSoft) was used for a sta-
tistical analysis. For group comparison, the Mann–Whitney 
test and Kruskal–Wallis test were used. Relations between 
quantitative variables were analyzed by Spearman correla-
tions. A p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
The characteristics of the investigated group are summarized 
in Table 1. In the investigated group, the men were signifi-
cantly more numerous compared to the women and the male 
patients were significantly younger than female (p < 0.05). 
The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma (50.0%) was 
noted. There were patients in stage I–IIIA of the disease 
(I-22.2%, II-61.1% and IIIa-16.7%, respectively). Due to a 
small number of patients in each group, we did not perform 
a comparison between the groups with different histologi-
cal types of cancer and between different stages of the dis-
ease. There were 6 active smokers, 8 ex-smokers and only 4 
patients who had never smoked cigarettes.
In the BALF analysis, the total cell count and differen-
tial cell count were similar when the clBALF and hlBALF 
were compared. There was an elevated proportion of neu-
trophils in the BALF: in the clBALF—22.5 ± 21.7%, in 
the hlBALF-23.6 ± 22.5%. The reference value of the pro-
portion of BALF neutrophils is <3%) [29].
The proportion of Tregs in the clBALF was 8.5% (p25–
p75 = 5.3–12.1) and was higher than in the hlBALF—5.0% 
(3.9–8.0) p  <  0.05 and PB—5.1% (4.4–6.4%), p  <  0.05, 
(Fig. 1).
We noticed a higher proportion of (s)CTLA-4-positive 
Tregs in the clBALF when compared to the hlBALF and 
PB; it was 7.6% (3.8–13.3) versus 5.9% (3.3–7.1) versus 
3.8% (2.0–8.9), respectively, difference nonsignificant. The 
median proportion of (in)CTLA-4-positive Tregs was also 
higher in the clBALF than in the hlBALF and PB 89.0% 
(83.2–96.3) versus 81.5% (61.7–92.0) versus 56.0% (54.1–
60.7), respectively, p  <  0.05, (Fig.  2, examples of flow 
cytometry gating of CTLA-4+ cells).
We calculated a ratio: (s)CTLA-4 to (in) CTLA-4 ((s) 
CTLA-4 Tregs/(in)CTLA-4 Tregs × 100%), and it was as 
follows: 8.1% (2.2–15.0) versus 6.9% (4.5–11.5) versus 
6.5% (3.8–15.2) in the clBALF, hlBALF and PB, respec-
tively, difference nonsignificant.
The median proportion of IL-17A concentration in 
the clBALF supernatant was 6.6 pg/ml (5.4–8.8) and was

Discussion
Lung cancer has a very insidious clinical course. Occur-
rence of resectable tumors does not exceed 30%; hence, the 
knowledge of the anticancer response and regulatory ele-
ments in the lung cancer environment is limited. It is also 
known that lungs show some individuality and specificity 
of the immune system and changes in the lung cancer envi-
ronment are different than those observed in the systemic 
environment reflected by PB examination.
In our study, we focused on the assessment of selected 
regulatory elements of the immune response in lung can-
cer. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study in 
which the panel of regulatory cells was identified in the 
BALF of lung cancer patients. We found significant dif-
ferences of Tregs proportion and Tregs with (in) CTLA-4 
expression between the local lung cancer environment and 
opposite lung and systemic response. We observed a sig-
nificant correlation of the proportion of these cells with 
IL-17A concentration in the BALF from the cancer milieu. 
We confirmed the usefulness of BALF examination in this 
study. Our study fits in a broad trend of research of immu-
nological markers as possible predictor factors in malignant 
tumors [30–32].
The study group consisted of patients with confirmed 
primary lung cancer in all stages of the disease and all types 
of NSCLC. The ratio of women to men was 1:2 which cor-
responds with literature data [33, 34]. 78% of patients were

active smokers or ex-smokers. The mean number of pack-
years among these patients was 36.3 ± 14.5. 78% of our 
patients did not report any symptoms of respiratory dis-
eases. The remaining 22% of the study group confirmed the 
presence of symptoms such as cough, dyspnea and hemop-
tysis. Thus, the clinical characteristics of patients remains 
in accordance with the references and confirms the proper 
qualification of patients [1, 35]. It should be pointed that 
we followed the exclusion criteria to avoid any influence 
of extrinsic factors possibly modifying the immune system.
In this study, we observed the higher proportion of Tregs 
in the clBALF than in the hlBALF and PB. We identified 
the cells which are most closely to a functionally effec-
tive Tregs population defined by CD4+/CD25high/Foxp3+/
CD127-. The CD4+/CD25high cells have a strong suppres-
sive activity [12], Foxp3 is connected per se with an inhibi-
tory T cell function [13] and the lack of CD127 expression 
discriminates Tregs from effector T cells [14].
Similar results were noted by Erfani et al. [20]. In their 
study, a percentage of Tregs was significantly higher in 
the patients with NSCLC than in the healthy donors; how-
ever, this investigation concerned the systemic immune 
response. The percentage of Tregs in the PB of healthy 
subjects in the study of Erfani et  al. was similar to the 
percentage of Tregs in the BALF from “healthy” lung 
and the PB in our study. In other studies, Liu et al. [36] 
and Okita et  al. [37] presented a higher proportion of 
Tregs (CD4+ CD25+) in the PB of patients with NSCLC 
when compared with healthy subjects. However, Tregs 
were identified based on the presence of only 2 antigens: 
CD4+ CD25high without Foxp3+. In this study, a higher 
percentage of Tregs in the PB of patients in an advanced 
stage of lung cancer than in the early stage of disease was 
shown [37]. In another study on patients with gastric can-
cer and esophageal cancer, a correlation between percent-
age of Tregs (CD4+ CD25high with Foxp3 mRNA) with 
the severity of disease was observed in both cancers. The 
percentage of Tregs negatively correlated with patients’ 
survival [38]. A positive correlation of Tregs (CD4+ 
CD25high and the Foxp3 mRNA) with the tumor stage was 
also noted in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [39]. 
Similar relationships have been shown in other studies on 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), lymph nodes and PB 
lymphocytes. Shigematsu et al. [40] found a higher propor-
tion of Tregs (CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+) in TIL and lymph 
nodes than in PB and presented that Tregs suppressed the 
induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against lung 
cancer cells. Petersen et al. [41] showed that patients with 
stage I NSCLC who had a high proportion of Tregs in TIL 
were at a significantly higher risk of recurrence. The com-
mon conclusion from our results and other studies is that 
the proportion of Tregs in BALF, among TIL and in lymph 
nodes, is higher than in PB and indicates a role of these 
cells in the modulation of immune response in the lung 
cancer microenvironment.
In this study, we analyzed two forms of the CTLA-4 
molecule on Tregs: surface and intracellular. We found a 
higher proportion of Tregs with the expression of CTLA-4 
in the clBALF than in hlBALF and PB. The median pro-
portion of (s)CTLA-4 Tregs was lower than (in)CTLA-4 
Tregs in each analyzed material. CTLA-4 is rapidly endo-
cytosed and accumulated in organelles [19]. The newly 
formed CTLA-4 molecules are stored in the structure of 
the Golgi apparatus and after activation are transported to 
the T cell surface, but next rapid endocytosis goes on [18]. 
Despite the relatively low surface expression of CTLA-4, 
it seems that a high concentration of intracellular CTLA-4 
may deliver ready for rapid transport to the T cell surface 
and participate in the inhibition of lymphocyte activation. 
In our study, we observed a significantly higher proportion 
of (in)CTLA-4 Tregs in the clBALF than in the hlBALF 
and PB. The difference between the cancerous lung and 
peripheral blood was significant only for (in)CTLA-4 but 
not for (s)CTLA-4. This finding supports the role of intra-
cellular domain in the process of immune response regula-
tion. Erfani et al. [20] observed that an increased propor-
tion of Tregs correlated with increased expression of the 
CTLA-4 molecule, which was related to the severity of the 
disease and poorer prognosis. In their study, the expression 
of CTLA-4 was analyzed on PB T cells, not Tregs. They 
showed a higher percentage of CD8+ cells with (s)CTLA-4 
and a higher percentage of CD4+ cells with (in)CTLA-4 
in the lung cancer patients as compared to the healthy sub-
jects. Furthermore, this work, as well as our results, shows 
that the surface expression of CTLA-4 molecule is lower 
than (in)CTLA-4, independently of the type of T cell sub-
populations. In another study, Kono et al. observed a higher 
percentage of Tregs (CD4+ CD25high) with intracellular 
expression of CTLA-4 in the PB of patients with stomach 
cancer and esophagus cancer and correlated with progres-
sion of the diseases [38]. Zheng et al. [42] showed a higher 
expression of CTLA-4 in NSCLC tissues than in normal 
tissue and no differences in relation to the histological type 
of cancer. To summarize it should be emphasized that our 
results on CTLA-4 on BALF Tregs cells are new and origi-
nal observation without references in the literature.
In the present study, we also calculated the (s):(in)
CTLA-4 ratio. This ratio can well characterize and reveal 
the movement of this molecule. This ratio was slightly 
higher in the BALF from the lung affected by cancer. This 
observation is important in the context of new anti-CTLA-4 
treatment (ipilimumab) effective in lung cancer [43]. A 
high surface presentation of CTLA-4 may be an accessible 
target for such a therapy, especially for the action of anti-
CTLA-4 antibodies in the local microenvironment. Thus, 
the confirmation of high expression of (s)CTLA-4 on the

BALF cells may serve in the future as a possible biomarker. 
Our results confirmed a strong relationship between the 
CTLA-4 molecule and Tregs, both of them have an immu-
nosuppressive function and the anti-CTLA-4 therapy is 
capable of targeting not only T effector cells but also regu-
latory T cells [10]. Further studies on CTLA-4 cellular traf-
fic and the differences in the expression of surface versus 
intracellular domains in the cancer environment could con-
tribute to finding an accurate biomarker for therapy.
In this study, we also showed the possible participation 
of IL-17 in regulation of antitumor immunity. We observed 
a higher median concentration of IL-17A in the lung cancer 
milieu when compared to opposite lung and PB. Moreover, 
we observed a positive significant correlation between the 
median proportion of Tregs and IL-17 A concentration only 
in the clBALF. There was a positive significant correlation 
between (in)CTLA-4+ Tregs and IL-17 concentration in 
the clBALF and a negative significant correlation between 
the median proportion of (in)CTLA-4+ Tregs and IL-17 A 
concentration in serum. Cantini et al. [44] in their experi-
mental study showed the interconnection between Tregs 
and Th17 cells, which are the main source of IL-17. Their 
results suggested that the polarization of Th17 cells can 
be induced by Tregs and Th17 cells can modulate tumor 
development in the course of gliomas. Yang et  al. [45] 
investigated Foxp3+ IL-17+ cells using flow cytometry in 
patients with colorectal cancer. They demonstrated a high 
expression of these cells in colon cancer tissue and sug-
gested that the population of these cells may influence on 
cancer growth.
On the other hand, in our study we observed a negative 
significant correlation between the median proportion of 
(in)CTLA-4+ Tregs and IL-17 A concentration in the sys-
temic environment. Some studies indicated possible anti-
tumor activity of IL-17 by the stimulation of specific effec-
tive immune response against the tumor cells and tumor 
growth inhibition. Kryczek et al. [21] showed that IL-17 
may be involved in the recruitment of effector CD8+ 
T cells by stimulation of the production of CXCL9 and 
CXCL10 in patients with ovarian cancer. They presented 
a negative correlation of tumor infiltrating Tregs and the 
level of IL-17 with the severity of the disease. Vasilescu 
et al. [46] analyzed the expression of Foxp3+ and IL-17 
by immunohistochemistry as a potential target for cancer 
immunotherapy in resected lung adenocarcinomas. Foxp3 
and IL-17 were present in TIL, tumor cells and fibro-
blasts; IL-17 was expressed also in periendothelial cells. 
The reaction in tumor cells was weaker than in other cells. 
A negative correlation between lymphocytes Foxp3+ 
and IL-17+ periendothelial cells was observed, suggest-
ing some antagonism. Similar results were obtained by 
Zhang et al. [47] who analyzed the ratio of Th17/Tregs in 
PB by flow cytometry and the serum IL-17 concentration 
by ELISA in patients with NSCLC. They showed that the 
Th17/Tregs ratio decreased in the patients with lung cancer 
compared to the healthy subjects and showed a negative 
correlation with the clinical stage of the disease. In addi-
tion, serum IL-17 concentration was lower in the patients 
with NSCLC than in the control group. Our results and the 
results of other authors indicate that Th17 cells and Tregs 
may have synergistic function in the tumor microenviron-
ment promoting cancer growth while the systemic role of 
IL-17 requires understanding of the dual function of this 
interleukin.
Conclusion
The most striking finding of our study was the confirmation 
of differences in the presence of regulatory cells between 
three compartments: the cancerous lung, healthy lung and 
PB reflected, respectively, by: the clBALF, hlBALF and PB 
derived from the same patient. The proportion of CD4+/
CD25high/Foxp3+/CD127- Tregs determined by flow 
cytometry and the proportion of Tregs with expression of 
(in)CTLA-4 were significantly elevated in the BALF har-
vested from the lung affected by lung cancer when com-
pared with the last two compartments. Moreover, we 
observed a significant correlation between the proportion of 
Tregs and (in)CTLA-4+ Tregs and IL-17A concentration 
only in clBALF. Our findings emphasize the usefulness 
of BALF analysis in the assessment of immune status of 
a lung cancer patient before therapy, which may serve for 
determination of possible biomarkers.
