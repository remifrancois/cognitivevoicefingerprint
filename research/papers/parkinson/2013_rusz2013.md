Parkinson’s disease (PD), a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, can manifest as an array of
motor and non-motor symptoms. Among these, speech and language impairments are particularly
prevalent, often preceding motor dysfunctions. Emerging research indicates that these impairments
may serve as early disease indicators. In this narrative review, we synthesised current ﬁndings on the
potential of speech and language symptoms in PD identiﬁcation and progression monitoring. Our
review highlights convergent, albeit preliminary, lines of evidence supporting the value of speech-
related features in detecting early or prodromal PD, even across language groups, especially with
sophisticated analytical techniques. Distinct speech patterns in PD subtypes and other neurological
disorders may assist in differential diagnosis and inform targeted management efforts. These features
also evolve over the disease course and could effectively be utilised for disease tracking and guide
management plan modiﬁcations. Advances in digital voice processing allow cost-effective, remote
and scalable monitoring for larger populations.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder char-
acterised by intracellular deposits of α-synuclein and progressive loss of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta1. It is the
fastest-growing and second-most common neurological disease currently
affecting approximately 10 million individuals worldwide with the ﬁgure
expected to double by 20502. While the principal manifestations include
impaired motor functions (e.g., resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia), a
multitude of non-motor symptoms occur concomitantly throughout the
disease course1,3,4, further contributing to the overall disease burden and
poorer quality of life for people with PD (PwPD) and their caregivers and
loved ones.
There is a recent shift to a biological deﬁnition of PD integrating
pathogenesis, genetics, biomarkers and clinical components of both motor
and non-motor features5,6; however, these newly proposed criteria are
intended exclusively for research purposes. Clinically, a diagnosis still relies
primarily on motor dysfunctions, speciﬁcally the presence of bradykinesia
combined with rigidity and/or resting tremor1. By this point, ~50–60% of
substantial nigra dopaminergic neuron loss and up to 70% of striatal
dopamine depletion have likely occurred7,8, which signiﬁcantly limits the
effectiveness of any neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies aiming
to slow or halt neurodegeneration9–11. Sensitive and reliable biomarkers of
PD at or before symptom onset are therefore urgently needed for such
interventions to be introduced early to achieve the optimal treatment
outcome.
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), a
parasomnia characterised by dream-enactment behaviours during loss of
REM sleep muscle atonia, is considered a key prodromal stage of
α-synucleinopathies12. However, RBD is not a speciﬁc or sensitive marker
for PD as it also occurs in other neurodegenerative disorders such as
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA)12,13,
and its prevalence in PD is relatively low ( ~ 24–42%)14,15. Moreover, the
need for a polysomnographic conﬁrmation12,16 further restricts its use at the
populational level.
Speech impairments, on the other hand, are particularly prevalent,
affecting up to 90% of PwPD17,18. Growing evidence indicates that speech
and language alterations often precede the deﬁning motor signs and PD
diagnosis by as much as a decade4,19–23; consequently, several guidelines
recommend incorporating speech and language pathology/therapy (SLP) as
a crucial component of PD care and rehabilitation from diagnosis24. Recent
research highlights the value of objective acoustic speech markers in
detecting PD in the initial or even prodromal (e.g., RBD) stages23,25,26. This
implicates a potential window for timely interventions, such as monoamine

oxidase B inhibitors, anticholinergics and future novel therapies that may
confer improved efﬁcacyin early PD stages9,11. Speech and language features
might also be used as a proxy measure for tracking disease progression and
status as they evolve over the course of the disease25,27–31. Moreover, speciﬁc
patterns of speech impairment have been linked to the presence of varying
disease subtypes characterised by distinct underlying pathologies23,29 and
have been shown to differentiate PD from other basal ganglia disorders32
and synucleinopathies23,33–35 as well as between PD subtypes36,37.
To reﬂect the current state of knowledge and inform future investi-
gations, we conducted a narrative review synthesising current evidence
pertinent to the value of speech and language biomarkers in PD prediction,
early detection and progression. Common speech and language difﬁculties
in PD and recommended speech tasks and measurement tools were only
brieﬂy described as multiple reviews have addressed these topics3,4,38–41.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases using
the search terms Parkinson’s disease” OR “Parkinson disease” OR “PD”
AND “language” OR “linguistic” OR “speech” OR “acoustics” OR “voice”
OR“ﬂuency”OR“intelligibility”OR“communication.”Referencelistsfrom
identiﬁed publications were also searched. Papers were reviewed and
selected based on their relevance to the focus of the review.
Speech and language assessment
The evaluation of speech and linguistic functions encompasses a set of
standardised tests that are applicable across various disciplines, including
conditions like PD and other movement disorders38–41. The recommended
and widely employed tests are 1) sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ in a
single breath, which helps assess breath control, vocal fold function and
vocal quality; 2) rapid repetition of syllables such as /pa/, /ta/ and /ka/ to
evaluate consonant and vowel articulation, articulation rate and regularity,
coordination and speech timing; 3) reading a passage that assesses articu-
lation, prosody and resonance and 4) verbal ﬂuency test (phonemic and
semantic naming) to assess lexicon access, verbal functioning and executive
control42,43 5) picture description and/or spontaneous monologue, which
provides insight into ﬂuency, language formulation at the lexical-semantic,
morpho-syntactic and discourse-pragmatic levels and overall speech and
language abilities38,39,41.
Following the administration of these tests, speech recordings are
analysed either perceptually by a qualiﬁed speech and language pathologist
or objectively through acoustic and linguistic analyses. Perceptual analysis
involves the use of standardised protocols to systematically describe speech
characteristics(e.g.,voicequality,articulation,rateandrhythm),theseverity
of dysarthria, overall intelligibility and naturalness of speech; these can help
gauge the functional aspects of communication deﬁcits17,38,44. Objective
analyses, on the other hand, utilise specialised software or digital interfaces
to quantify various acoustic parameters related to spectral characteristics of
voice signals and linguistic features from speech transcripts, providing a
more in-depth and sensitive approach to assessing an individual’s speech
and language abilities4,38,41. With automated signal processing, these objec-
tive tools are also more accessible and scalable, allowing for remote
monitoring.
Consideration of self-perception of voice, speech and language
impairment is advocated as can provides important insights into the impact
of PD on functional communication in real-world contexts45–49. Example
toolsusedinthiscontextincludetheVoiceHandicapIndex45,theDysarthria
Impact Scale50 and the Dysarthria Impact Proﬁle48. They provide valuable
information on the subjective perception of impact; however, they are less
sensitive to minor ﬂuctuations in function and may be affected by ﬂooring
and ceiling effects inherent to the evaluation scales employed.
Voice, speech and language alterations in PD
Impaired speech in PD can result from disruption to some or all subsystems
involved in speech production, including phonation, articulation, prosody,
respirationandresonance.Theseimpairmentsaretypicallycharacterisedby
diminished loudness reﬂected by a soft or asthenic voice51, reduced varia-
bility
in
loudness
and
pitch
resulting
in
a
monopitch
and
monoloudness25,26,30,51, a harsh and/or breathy voice quality17,32 and impre-
cise articulation25,52, all contributing to decreased intelligibility17,53. Inap-
propriate pauses and inconsistent speech rates such as abrupt deceleration
or acceleration of speech have also been reported4,26,54,55, which collectively
can be classiﬁed as “hypokinetic dysarthria”53. These perceptual changes are
reﬂected in objective acoustic features including reduced range and varia-
tion in voice intensity and fundamental frequency (f0), shorter maximum
phonation time, lower harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) and cepstral peak
prominence (CPP), restricted vowel space area (VSA) and lower vowel
articulation index (VAI), longer voice onset time (VOT), increased per-
turbations in the amplitude and frequencyof sound wavesdescribed as jitter
and shimmer, respectively, slower and irregular diadochokinetic rate and
prolonged pause intervals3,19,30,37,56.
While most communication research in PD has focused on motor
speech functions, impaired language is associated with PD. The verbal
output of PwPD relative to individuals without PD is often less
informative23,31,57, concise58, grammatically intact31 and complex58,59, relying
more on content words rather than functional words (e.g., prepositions and
conjunctions)23 during narrative or other structured tasks. At the con-
versational level, word-ﬁnding difﬁculties or “tip-of-the-tongue” phenom-
enon and challenges in initiating and maintaining a topic have been
observed4,60. PwPD can also have difﬁculties recognising and interpreting
non-verbal cues such as emotion expressed through facial expression or
tones61–63, in addition to reduced body gestures and ﬂattened affect3,60,63,
making it harder for them to engage in conversations.
A short glossary of speech and language terminologies used in this
study isoutlined in Table 1.A schematic illustrating the strategic integration
of speech and language markers across the PD continuum to facilitate
clinical decision-making and better management of the disease is depicted
in Fig. 1.
Preclinical or prodromal speech and language markers for early
PD detection and prediction
In the PD progression trajectory proposed by Braak et al.64, Lewy body
pathology in Stages 1–2 is conﬁned to the brainstem, affecting the glosso-
pharyngeal and vagal nerves, which innervate the laryngeal and pharyngeal
musculature and coordinate articulatory and respiratory activities19,21,65, and
olfactory regions before reaching the substantia nigra. In accordance with
Braak’s staging, Selby66 also hypothesised a caudorostral symptom pro-
gression in PD, starting with failure in speech-related respiratory control
and then articulation involving the larynx, pharynx, tongue and lips.
Converging evidence now suggests that voice and speech alterations, along
with abnormalities in swallowing and smell, are among the earliest signs of
PD and may serve as early markers for diagnosis and prediction.
Dysprosodywasconsistentlyobservedintheearlyandevenprodromal
stagesofthediseaseacrossdifferentlanguages.Inamulticentrecohortstudy
administered in Czech, English, German, French and Italian languages,
monopitch differentiated groups, even in the prodromal phase of PD25. In
this study, early speech markers were explored in 150 participants with
idiopathic RBD, 149 with early-stage PD (mean disease duration 1.7–2.5
years) and 149 controls. Four speech tasks including sustained phonation,
fast syllable repetition (/pa//ta//ka/), text reading and narration were
administered at baseline and 12-month follow-up. A signiﬁcant difference
was noted in monopitch, prolonged pauses and imprecise consonants
between PD and control participants, resulting in an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.80 for group classiﬁcation. Monopitch and prolonged pauses
were also different between RBD and PD, with an AUC of 0.72 when
combined with extra features including harsh voice and articulation rate.
Similarly, monopitch separated RBD subjects from controls, though with a
smaller AUC of 0.65, by incorporating the same additional features.
The relationship between prominent speech features like prosody in
prodromal PD and other markers of the disease such as altered olfactory
functions and nigrostriatal system have also been investigated in Czech67.

Similar to earlier work, data suggest that prosodic impairment can present
prior to the appearance of nigro-putaminal dopaminergic deﬁcits, with
dysprosody and olfactory dysfunctions co-occurring. Reduced pitch varia-
bility was detected in people with RBD and hyposmia but not those with
normal olfaction compared to healthy individuals67. Additionally, while
monopitch at baseline was independent of putamen binding ratio captured
by dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography
(DAT-SPECT), deterioration in impaired pitch variability was only seen in
the RBD subgroup with hyposmia and abnormal DAT-SPECTat the 2-year
follow-up.
Again, using RBD as a model for prodromal PD, a French-speaking
cohort yielded similar outcomes in exploring voice characteristics from
prodromal to early PD26. Both RBD and PD groups produced more
monotonous speech alongside longer pause durations and an unsteady
rhythm, compared to the control group26. Leveraging voice features
extracted from automated acoustic analysis and supervised learning clas-
siﬁcations, early PD was classiﬁed with 89% accuracy for males and 70% for
females, while RBD detection achieved an accuracy of 63–70%. It is note-
worthy that more pronounced prosodic deﬁcits were observed during
emotional encounters during task performance, implying that tasks with
higher emotional demands could offer greater sensitivity in detecting early,
nuanced speech alterations.
Voweldistortion is a keycomponent of dysarthricspeech.It istypically
measured by exploring the distribution of the ﬁrst and second formants68.
There is some preliminary evidence to suggest composite measures of vowel
production differ in PwPD prior to the commencement of therapy and
matched controls52. These parameters include the VSA and VAI derived
from connected speech tasks. It is also noted that spontaneous speech tasks
(e.g., monologue), which are more complex with higher articulatory
demands,betterseparated groups compared to non-spontaneoustasks(e.g.,
sentence repetition and passage reading)52.
Vowel articulation deﬁcits may also be present in the prodromal
stage69. In a study exploring whether altered vowel articulation was a pro-
dromal symptom of synucleinopathy in a larger male sample (60 RBD, 60
de-novo (newly diagnosed), untreated PD and 60 age-matched controls),
both the RBD and PD groups exhibited signiﬁcantly smaller VSA during
passage reading than controls and lower VAI was found in PD compared to
controls69. The results also revealed that imprecise vowels evaluated by both
acoustic indices correlated with the Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and the severity of bradykinesia and rigidity
but not axial gait symptoms or tremor. Furthermore, a positive correlation
was observed between the putamen binding ratio detected from DAT-
SPECT and VSA in RBD, suggesting that nigrostriatal neurodegeneration
might play a role in articulatory impairment.
Advances in digital voice processing and machine learning utilising
speech signals have propelled research forward in the detection and pre-
diction of PD. Sophisticated feature selection and classiﬁcation models have
been proposed to be able to effectively distinguish PwPD from healthy
individuals70–73, regardless of the presence of overt symptoms74, and even
people in prodromal PD (e.g., RBD)75 with motor symptoms from those
without73,basedonsetsofsimplespeechtasks.Morerecentstudieshavealso
demonstrated the scalability and accessibility of these detection tools to a

wider population with their capability of operating effectively on mobile
devices70,75–77. Sustained vowel task, among other tests, was widely
adopted65,70–72,74. Data suggest that ~99% discrimination accuracy can be
achieved65, using even just a handful of dysphonic measures by support
vector machines72. However, overﬁtting is likely due to the model com-
plexity and limited training samples, without validation on novel datasets.
When the same technique was applied to a larger cohort (1078 PwPD and
5453 controls), the accuracy dropped to < 70%78, though the reduced per-
formance may also be linked to the poorer sound quality of phone calls78
compared to controlled and standardised speech sampling72.

their own set of advantages and challenges. Machine learning algorithms
can uncovercomplexpatterns and subtle voice and speech changes in early-
stagePDthatconventionalmodelsmightmiss,leadingtomoreaccurateand
nuanced predictions. However, these advanced models often lack inter-
pretability due to their “black box” nature, making it challenging to
understand the decision-making processes that are crucial for clinical
validation. Additionally, the transferability of these advanced models to
clinical settings requires extensive validation to ensure they work across
diverse populations and clinical settings.
Compared to motor speech features, fewer research efforts have been
directed to early PD language and conversational limitations, and that on
preclinical or prodromal language alterations remain scarce. However,
there is evidence indicating that language deﬁcits are detectable in pro-
dromal PD and tasks with higher cognitive demands can distinguish RBD
and PD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from controls as well as
RBD and PD with intact cognition with an AUC of up to 0.8279. In this
study, prodromal linguistic markers were investigated in 40 RBD cases
and 40 de-novo PD cases without MCI, 14 RBD cases and 15 de-novo PD
cases with MCI and 30 controls79. It is observed that both RBD groups had
lower content density than controls during spontaneous discourse,
whereas RBD and PD subgroups with MCI exhibited poorer lexical
diversity and more frequent phrase repetitions than both subgroups
without MCI and controls in a story narration task. The results also
showed that only 7.5% of RBD subjects without MCI had an abnormal
DAT-SPECT,implyingthatthepresenceoflinguisticabnormalitiesmight
precede the substantia nigra degeneration.
Impaired linguistic function at the prodromal disease phase (RBD)
might serve as a language-universal predictor for synucleinopathies. In one
longitudinal study23, a narration task was submitted to 180 idiopathic RBD
subjects and 149 controls speaking Czech, English, German, French and
Italian for elicitation of three linguistic (content richness, vocabulary range
and sentence complexity) and two acoustic features (articulatory pace and
pause durations) using an automated approach. The overall pheno-
conversion over a 5-year follow-up on average was linked to lower content
richness, slower articulation rate and prolonged pauses. Among those who
developed a certain synucleinopathy, the conversion of dementia and PD
with MCI compared to PD without MCI was associated with greater
baseline severity of linguistic impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 109.18). Spe-
ciﬁcally, lower content richness was linked to a higher risk of PD with MCI
(OR = 7.46)andrestrictedvocabularyrangewasassociatedwithhigherrisks
of dementia (OR = 4.08) compared to PD alone. The across-languages
applicability of language as well as acoustic markers is also reﬂected in
dysarthria treatments. For instance, following Lee Silverman Voice Treat-
ment, vocal intensity was increased in Cantonese, Japanese, French, Man-
darin and Italian speakers with PD, while intonation was improved in
Portuguese, German and Cantonese speakers80. Nonetheless, other features,
such as VSA and rhythm, appeared to be language-speciﬁc, and further
investigations are required.
Syntactic deﬁcits might even be a preclinical sign of PD. In a small
cohort comprising 33 people with sporadic PD without risk mutations, 8
withgeneticPD(PARK2orLRRK2mutations),9asymptomatic ﬁrst-degree
relatives of people with genetic PD and 56 healthy controls with no familial
history of PD81, group comparisons revealed that both sporadic and genetic
PD groups performed worse on all executive and language tasks (e.g., action
semantics, object semantics and action naming) compared to controls. Of
interest, asymptomatic mutation carriers displayed signiﬁcantly poorer
syntactic comprehension than controls, implicating the role PARK2 or
LRRK2 mutations may have on language-processing mechanisms. None-
theless, this preliminary evidence comes with caveats due to the extremely
limited sample sizes, and replication in larger datasets is needed.
Other studies focused on early-stage PD have reported faster speaking
rates characterised by short rapid output segments but longer hesitations
and less word production55, impairments in alternating semantic verbal
ﬂuency (e.g., naming animals and then furniture and then alternating back

and forth)82 and pragmatic skills (the ability to adapt communication
techniques in terms of language comprehension and production to different
social contexts)83. However, whether these symptoms are manifested in the
prodromal phases is uncertain and needs to be explored in future research.
Speech and language markers for differential diagnosis from
other neurodegenerative conditions
PD and atypical Parkinson’s syndromes such as MSA and progressive
supranuclear palsy (PSP) present with overlapping clinical features84,
making accurate diagnosis challenging, especially on initial clinical eva-
luation. However, a few studies have highlighted that the distinct patho-
physiology of atypical Parkinsonism results in unique speech symptom
proﬁles,anddetailedacousticandlanguageevaluationcanhelpdiscriminate
PD from MSA and PSP33,85,86, even in the early disease process34,35,87.
In comparison to PD, speech impairment in atypical Parkinsonism is
generally more pronounced34,35,85–88, possibly related to its more widespread
and severe pathology and more rapid disease progression84. For instance,
greater severity of imprecise consonants33,85,86, articulatory decay33,86 and
diadochokinetic irregularity33,86, slower diadochokinetic and speech rate33,86
and longer pause times34,86 are frequently observed in MSA and PSP
compared to PD.
PD dysarthria presents mainly as hypokinetic35,88, while dysarthria in
atypical Parkinsonism, in particular MSA and PSP, is often mixed involving
differing combinations of hypokinetic, spastic and ataxic components86–88.
More speciﬁcally, the speech of people with MSA is predominantly hypo-
kinetic-ataxic, characterised by strained-strangled voice quality87,88, exces-
sive pitch and loudness ﬂuctuations87,88, vocal tremor87,88, variable rate of
speech33 and imprecise consonants85; whereas speech in PSP is described as
hypokinetic-spastic with strained-strangled voice quality87, varied speech
rate33,88, stuttering like behaviour and involuntary syllable or word
repetition89.
Recent work suggests that diverging speech patterns may allow for
better separation of PD, MSA and PSP groups. For instance, maximum
phonation time, ataxia symptoms (tremulous voice, uncontrolled pitch and
loudness variations during sustained phonation) and spastic features
(strained, squeezing voice, phonation breaks and voiceless ratio during the
same task) can split MSA and PD87. Spastic speech dimensions can also
differentiate people with PSP and PD87. When using a combination of these
distinct speech patterns, PD can be accurately distinguished from MSA and
PSP with an accuracy of 87–95%33,88, even at early disease stages34.
Atypical Parkinsonism might affect language to a greater extent
compared to PD, though evidence is equivocal. When matching for age,
education and global cognitive function, people with PSP exhibit severe
impairments in phonological and semantic ﬂuency, reﬂecting greater
executive function damage, followed by those with MSA and then PwPD90.
The PSP and MSA groups also present with more severe behavioural
symptoms, including apathy and depression compared to PwPD90. PD and
MSA groups appear to be more closely aligned on language disturbances,
with the latter showing worse executive function and semantic ﬂuency91 but
similar performance in other language testing such as repetition of words
and non-words, repetition of sentences, word reading, semantic association,
number of phonological errors/number of words and picture description92.
A combined measure encompassing the full speech and language assay
might enhance group differentiation.
Studies comparing PD and other neurological conditions involving
movement disorders lend further support for the speciﬁcity of speech
markers. PwPD and people with Huntington’s disease (PwHD) can exhibit
distinct phonatory and resonatory characteristics as well as language pro-
duction deﬁcits. Based upon the assessment of sustained phonation and
monologue task performance, a harsh or hoarse voice was more frequently
noted in PwPD compared to controls32, whereas PwHD can present with
more severe dysphonia and breathiness32 and increased and intermittent
hypernasality, likely reﬂecting the velopharyngeal mechanism’s choreatic
motions93. In terms of language functions, while both groups produced
fewer grammatical sentences (e.g., subject-verb-objective) and verbal
content that was less informative than controls, PwHD tend to produce
shorter utterances with greater syntactic simpliﬁcation than PwPD, despite
performing similarly on cognitive and motor speech tasks57.
PD can also be accurately separated from essential tremor (ET) even
across language groups with the use of automated speech signal processing
and machine learning algorithms94. A recent study proposed a classiﬁcation
model forPDand ET based on articulatory, phonatory and prosodic indices
elicited via rapid syllable repetition and monologue tasks94. Data demon-
strated that the models trained in German and Spanish achieved a classi-
ﬁcationaccuracyofupto81%formonologueand86%forsyllablerepetition
when applied to a Czech-speaking cohort.
While existing evidence underpins the promising diagnostic and
screening values of objective speech assessment in differentiating PD from
other Parkinsonian syndromes, it should be noted that most of these studies
werelimitedbyverysmallsamplesizeswithcasesubgroupsrangingfrom10
to 30 participants. Additionally, there is evidence that speaker sex, often not
accounted for in these studies, inﬂuences speech outcomes in PD and
similar neurodegenerative disorders, with males generally experiencing
greater impairment32,35. During early disease stages, males with MSA can
display a considerably increased f0, slower speech rate and longer pauses
compared to those with PD, whereas MSA females but not males or those
withPDcanmanifestvoicetremorandloudnessdecay35.Similarly,although
both sexes exhibit poorer voice quality in PD and HD, males with PD
experiencemoreseverebreathinessinspeechandthosewithHDshowmore
pronounced hoarseness compared to their female counterparts32. This dif-
ferential effect may stem from the physiological distinctions between sexes
in terms of the structure of vocal folds and larynx and sexual hormonal
levels95,96, which also lead to variations in voice changes as a result of normal
aging56,96,97. Thus, future studies with larger populations from multiple
centres and proper sex stratiﬁcations are needed to validate these initial
ﬁndings.
Differential speech and language patterns among PD subtypes
It is well recognised that PD has a wide range of clinical manifestations and
prognosis98,99, indicating the presence of multiple subtypes with varying
disease mechanisms. Markers of different PD phenotypes are therefore
needed to better allocate patient groups and guide more appropriate and
individualised clinical management. Speech, the product of highly complex
motor and cognitive coordination100, is particularly sensitive to neural
structure damage and could potentially aid in classifying disease subtypes.
Multiple studies have documented the distribution of affected speech
domains across PD phenotypes. In particular, an association has been
observed between the severity of speech disturbances, especially temporal
disruptions and dysrhythmicity, and axial motor symptoms in PD29,37,
including gait freezing101–103, festination104 and instability36,105,106, implicating
a shared pathomechanism between speaking and walking dysfunctions.
Early evidence came from a large cohort of 800 people with early PD (mean
symptom duration = 2 years) from the DATATOP clinical trial monitored
for approximately 14 months101. Speech performance measured subjectively
via clinical rating scales, among other motor traits, is a strong risk factor for
the development of freezing of gait101. Speech and handwriting abnormal-
ities measured within the UPDRS were also related to episodes of gait
freezing, but not rigidity, bradykinesia or balance, in a Levodopa “on”
state102. Further, the decrease in gait freezing frequency in response to
Levodopa was strongly associated with an improvement in speech. Similar
relationships were observed in an “off-medication” state, where changes in
gait velocity, cadence (steps/min) and stride length were correlated with
changes in speech initiation time, speech rate and the number of repetitions
during sentence reading in patients with gait freezing103.
The link between speech and gait is reﬂected in other motor assays.
During diadochokinetic tasks (syllable repetition), involuntary speeding up
of speech (known as oral festination) correlated strongly with festination of
gait when PwPD were in the “off Levodopa” state104. This also plays out
where prominent articulatory-prosodic abnormalities change in line with
greaterpostural instability/gait difﬁculties (PIGD)106. Moreover, the severity

of overall speech impairment in the PIGD subtype was found to be greater
compared to the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype36,105, with distinct char-
acteristics allowing for differentiation between the two PD phenotypes105.
Speciﬁcally, while both TD and PIGD subtypes displayed monopitch and
irregular diadochokinetic rate, consonant timing deﬁcits, abnormal pitch
breaks, articulatory decay, decreased speech rate in subsequent segments
and inappropriate pauses were found only in PIGD compared to
controls36,105. Additionally, the correlations between speech (e.g., prolonged
VOT, diadochokinetic irregularity and prolonged pauses) and gait (e.g.,
slower gait velocity, decreased cadence and shorter stride length) features
were observed in the PIGD but not TD subgroup36. It is also worth noting
that the severity of PIGD is also associated with impaired global cognition,
executive function, memory and phonemic ﬂuency107.
As indicated by other lines of work, discernible patterns of dysarthria
are thought to be associated with the onset and form (sporadic versus
monogenic) as well as cognitive involvement of the disease. PwPD with a
late onset (age of onset at ≥70 years) seem to exhibit more pronounced
speech impairment, whereas those with an early onset (age of onset at ≤50
years) have greater motor dysfunctions including impaired strength of
inspiratory muscle37. When comparing subgroups of newly diagnosed PD
with an early or late onset prior to treatment commencement to age- and
sex-matched healthy controls (n = 24 for each subgroup), monopitch,
monoloudness and articulatory decay were consistently related to PD
regardless of age; however, weaker inspirations (the relative loudness of
respiration to speech) were a distinct feature of early-onset PD, while
decreased voice quality and imprecise consonant articulation were unique
characteristics of late-onset PD37.
Sporadic and genetic PD can result in mixed acoustic proﬁles. Con-
sistent with previous research indicating heterogeneous neuropathology
between the two forms of PD108,109, preliminary data suggest that PD asso-
ciated with mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene may
exert a distinct impact on speech compared to idiopathic PD110. In one case,
voice characteristics based on sustained phonation, such as entropy (cal-
culated following sound wavelet decomposition and quantiﬁes the degree of
randomness in a voice signal), skewness of the amplitude distribution,
glottis to noise excitation ratio (signal strength relative to noise) and vocal
fold excitation ratio (signal strength versus noise) combined with other
acoustic parameters differentiated the two subtypes with a mean sensitivity
of 95% and speciﬁcity of 90%110. Differences were also observed among
asymptomatic LRRK2-mutation carriers, asymptomatic relatives without
LRRK2-mutations and unrelated healthy controls, although to a lesser
degree (sensitivity 75–76% and speciﬁcity 78–82%). Nonetheless, the gen-
eralisability of this evidence is constrained by the limited sample size with
only 7–20 individuals in each PD subgroup. Further validation in larger
cohorts is necessary to conﬁrm these initial ﬁndings.
Linguistic and speech features may indicate declined cognition in PD,
even in the early stages and mild forms. Greater linguistic impairment
associated with MCI can be seen through reduced content density23, a
smaller lexicon and more frequent dysﬂuencies in both PD and the RBD
prodromal phase79. Pausing patterns also appear to be a useful marker of
MCI in PD4,111,112. The location (e.g., pauses before and between utterances
irrespective of verb class) and duration of pauses within utterances during a
picture description task were found to be associated with cognitive function
in PD evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)111,112.
PwPD with MCI present with longer pauses between and within utterances
as well as before action utterances and more frequent pauses before and
within utterances than those with unremarkable cognition111. The associa-
tion between pauses before action but not non-action utterances and cog-
nitive dysfunction persists even after controlling for age, sex and UPDRS
motor scores. Similarly, motor speech function can also reﬂect cognitive
impairment, with lower f0 variation, CPP113 and VAI114, as well as more
pronounced temporal coordination deﬁcits112. Notably, tasks with a higher
cognitive load, such as story retelling compared to reading, may more
effectively capture alterations in cognition112,115.
Wearereachingapointwheredistinctpatternsofspeechandlinguistic
features across PD phenotypes can be identiﬁed, supporting their potential
as valuable tools for detecting and differentiating patient subgroups, even
early in the disease process, to facilitate timely and personalised interven-
tions. However, it is important tonote that nearly all current studies focused
on only one aspect of the disease spectrum, and the utility of speechmarkers
in simultaneously identifying disease subtypes needs attention.
Speech and language markers of PD stages and progression
Speech and language functioning declines as PD progresses. Several lines of
research have provided initial evidence on the value of acoustic markers
across different speech subsystems as well as linguistic features in estimating
the progression and severity of the disease. Early investigations assessing
PwPD at early (disease duration ≤5 years without motor ﬂuctuations) and
late stages (disease duration ≥6 years) as compared to controls implicate a
cooccurrence between changes in the characteristics of speech and voice
dysfunctionsanddiseaseseverityandduration51.Basedonsustainedvowels,
scaling/gliding singing and monologue, people at late PD stages manifest a
perceptually softer and more prominent breathy voice compared to those at
early stages, with vocal tremor being a unique feature of advanced PD. The
extent of vocal loudness reduction, limited variability in pitch and loudness,
restricted maximum phonation frequency range, jitter and breathiness
deterioratesas PD progresses. Among these, monopitch and monoloudness
may differentiate the three groups. Sex-speciﬁc voice changes were also
observed, with higher mean and minimum f0 in advanced stages for males
and a more pronounced reduction in f0 variability and maximum f0 in
females. However, this pattern can occur as a part of normal aging96, and
whether it signals more widespread disease pathology is unclear.
Evidence from a larger PD cohort (n = 200) utilising a 2 min con-
servational speech task documents a gradual deterioration of speech
accompanied by corresponding changes in different speech domains17.
Dysphonia, including harsh voice quality, decreased volume and impaired
intonation are common and predominantly impact the speaker in the initial
PD stages. As the disease and overall speech impairment become more
pronounced, the prevalence and degree of articulatory (e.g., imprecise
articulation due to articulatory movement undershoot) and ﬂuency
impairments (e.g., difﬁculties in motor initiation, inappropriate pauses,
syllable repetition and rushes in speech) increase, with articulation deﬁcits
being the most prevalent and signiﬁcant feature in advanced stages.
Efforts to apply automated speech processing and novel machine
learning methods to predict disease status and severity utilising speech
samples as simple as sustained phonation116–120 or combined with other
tasks76,121 provide corroborating evidence. Analysis of acoustic indices
extracted from sustained vowels over 2 years revealed increased perturba-
tions in sound frequency and intensity in PwPD, which predicted PD
progression measured by UPDRS part III with an error rate of ~26% and
part IV with an error rate of ~11%116. Higher accuracies were obtained by
employing
more

and

algorithms117,118,120,121, or incorporating simple motor tasks76. For instance,
the UPDRS total and motor scores over an interval of ~6 months can be
preciselyestimatedbyrandomforestclassiﬁersbasedonphonatoryacoustic
measures, with a discrepancy of < 2 points from the clinician’s ratings117,118.
The integration of extra motor information such as posture, gait and ﬁnger

the presence and status of the disease76. Notably, the extension to smart-
phone applications marks a pivotal juncture in remote symptom mon-
itoring on a more regular basis76,117,118, facilitating more effective disease
management and improved patient care.
While multiple studies provide compellingevidence on the potentialof
speech markers in tracking disease progression, important methodological
limitations are noted; most of them either adopted a cross-sectional
approach51, relied solely on case observations116–118 or both17,119–121. Small
sample sizes ( < 100) used in model training and lack of validation in
independent populations also raise concerns about the potential overﬁtting.

Longitudinal comparisons with control groups generally provide more
powerinassuringthatchangesinspeecharetheresultofdiseaseprogression
rather than natural aging or individual variability in symptomatology.
Evidence from this study design can also provide insights into the cooc-
currence of progressive voice and speech impairment with the overall dis-
ease course. An instable pace and pace acceleration during syllable during
syllable repetitions may present in PD with further deterioration over the
disease course, as observed over a period of 34 months on average (range =
12–88 months)28. These features evaluated by diadochokinetic tasks dif-
ferentiated PwPD from healthy individuals at baseline, though data is not
available for controls at follow-up examinations28. In this cohort, alterations
in speech functionsareindependent of the UPDRS motor scores, suggesting
that impaired syllable repetition could potentially be used as a marker of
non-dopaminergic disease progression in PD. However, PD can manifest as
varying speaking rates, and evidence regarding the characteristics and
temporal changes of over time in the disease course is often mixed. Some
data suggests that PwPD speak at faster rates than those without the con-
dition as evaluated by different speech tasks (standard passage reading122 or
narration of a self-chosen topic123) with subsequent increases in speech rate
andimpairmentsovertime,whereasothersindicateaslowerspeechrate31or
a gradual decline towards normal patterns124.
Sex may play an important role. Data from a German-speaking cohort
revealed that although the total speech rate of males with PD was sig-
niﬁcantly faster than age-matched male controls at baseline, this difference
diminished after a mean interval of 25 months (range = 7–79 months) and
was comparable to that of controls at follow-up124. In PD females, while
there is a progressive decline in prosodic abilities indicated by notably
reduced lower range and standard deviation of f0 compared to female
controls at both time points, ﬂuctuations in speech rate are not observed124.
Altered cognition in PD can also have an impact. Slowed speech rate, which
further declined over time, was observed in PD complicated by dementia
compared to non-demented PD31, possibly related to the consequent difﬁ-
culties in planning, initiating and maintaining speech output.
Changes in speech loudness and output length also vary based on the
speciﬁc cohort sampled in a study. Over an average timeframe of 3.7 years,
vocal loudness assessed within a reading task increased in one PD cohort
compared to controls122 but remained stable in the other cohort using a
narration task123. Similarly, utterance length decreased from the ﬁrst to
second time points in one PD cohort to a greater extent than in controls123,
whereas no signiﬁcant changes were observed either between groups or
between time points in another cohort122. Discrepancies between studies
might be attributed to 1) small sample sizes, ranging from only eight to ﬁfty
individuals with and without PD, respectively, which could substantially
impede the reliability and generalisability of the ﬁndings; 2) bias introduced
by the heterogeneity among PwPD in terms of disease duration upon
enrolment, treatment or medication regimes and possibly disease subtypes;
3) variable time intervals between data collection points among PwPD and
between PDand controlgroups,althoughspeechperformance was found to
be independent of the intervals between examinations124 or 4) intrinsic
variability in each person’s pathological processes and disease course.
Imprecise vowel articulation could serve as a marker for disease status
as its deterioration likely parallels the progression of the disease and espe-
cially axial motor symptoms29. Using the triangular VSA (tVSA) and VAI of
vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ extracted from a standardised passage reading task,
PwPD exhibit progressively impaired vowel articulation over an interval of
~33 months, with VAI appearing to be more sensitive to altered vowels and
further decline in performance over time29. Of interest, although being
independent of overall motor impairment evaluated by UPDRS part III or
disease duration, a decline in both tVSA and VAI correlated with axial gait
dysfunctions as measured by the UPDRS gait subscores.
Alterationsinotherspeechmodalitiesmayalsoreﬂectdiseaseprogress.
Assessment on a broader scale, encompassing both perceptually and
acoustically measured phonation, articulation, prosody and ﬂuency along
with perceptual intelligibility, in a larger sample (80 PwPD and 60 age- and
sex-matched controls) revealed that impaired voice and speech functions
may be present even in the mild form of the disease and continue to decline
in the disease course27. Based on the performance in reading and sustained
vowel tasks, PwPD showed a decline in all perceptually evaluated speech
modalitiesandacousticparametersincludingshimmer,noise-to-harmonics
ratio, net speech rate, VAI and stop consonant articulation over 12 to
88 months27. Notably,perceptual speech decline correlated with the baseline
Hoehn-Yahr scale disease stages and UPDRS motor scores, while pause
ratio and percentage of pauses within polysyllabic words from acoustic
analysis correlated with disease stages at baseline and follow-up.
Longitudinal research, though relatively limited, suggests that the
decline in higher-level language functioning and speech-related breathing
also occurs in tandem with the progression of PD. Compensatory speech
respiratory adaptations (e.g., increase in lung volume excursion and vital
capacity per syllable to maintain subglottal pressure for speech production)
that are typically seen in normal aging may be compromised in PD, which
can instead induce opposite alterations in these mechanisms such as low-
ered lung volume at initiation and termination of speech122 and decreased
lung volume excursion123. PwPD, in comparison to healthy individuals, also
experience reduced oral ﬂuency and inappropriate pauses that worsen over
disease progression54. Less frequent breath pauses at major syntactic
boundaries and periods and more breath pauses at non-punctuational
locations were also noted as PD progressed. In particular, breath pauses at
non-syntactic boundaries and linguistic errors including repetitions of
multiple words, additions during passage reading and other deviations from
the given content were identiﬁed as the main attributing factors to overall
speech impairment54.
Language production capabilities may also progressively decline over
time, especially in the presence of altered cognitive capacity. When eval-
uated on a picture narration task, the verbal output is shorter and less
informative in PwPD with dementia and people with DLB compared to
healthy individuals and PwPD without dementia31. PwPD with dementia
also experienced a signiﬁcant decline in all language measures (e.g., ﬂuency,
grammar and content density) during a mean period of 38 months, while
PwPD without dementia remained stable. Speech and language impair-
ments, according to the structural MRI scans, were related to grey matter
atrophyinregionsimportantforlanguageperformancebutnotmotorbrain
regions. However, this evidence is still tentative considering the constrained
sample size.
Taken together, initial explorations in small cohorts have shed light on
voice, speech and language changes occurring over the course of PD that are
independent of normal aging. Acoustic and language features appear sen-
sitive for monitoring disease status as they alter progressively over time even
though motor symptoms remain widely stable.
Gaps and future directions
Currently available evidence seems to conﬁrm that speech features hold
promise for early disease detection, prediction as well as disease progress
tracking. Validated speech and language analysis tools can become a viable
componentofhealthcarepracticeduringhealthcheck-upsandscreeningfor
at-risk individuals, such as older adults and people with a family history of
PD or early motor symptoms.
However, ﬁndings are somewhat conﬂicting especially regarding the
longitudinal changes of speech and language functioning, likely due to
heterogeneity among the underlying study populations. Replication in lar-
ger cohorts across ancestral and language groups (e.g., non-European
populations) and studies following people newly diagnosed with PD before
the commencement of treatment are necessary to substantiate existing
ﬁndings and to elucidate the natural progression of speech-related
symptoms.
Notably, existing research has primarily anchored on motor speech
features, particularly phonation, articulation and prosody, while largely
overlooking cognitive-linguistic abnormalities. To gain a comprehensive
understanding of how PD impacts speech, it is essential to explore a broader
spectrum of related impairments. This includes voice quality, respiration
and resonance, as well as linguistic and language aspects such as lexicon,

grammar,syntax,verbaloutputcontentandﬂuency.Integratingbothmotor
and cognitive-linguistic metrics will help delineate a complete picture of
speech and language changes in PD and identify the best combination of
markers for effective disease detection and prediction.
In a similar vein, while distinct speech patterns have been linked to
different disease phenotypes, studiesoftenconcentrate on isolated subtypes.
However, evaluation of speech features across multiple PD subtypes can
reveal overlapping and unique patterns that might not be apparent when
studied in isolation, which can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient
group allocation. Thus, further research on clinical phenotyping through a
holistic lens is needed to determine the utility of speech indicators for
concurrent recognition of various PD subtypes.
Future studies exploring functional communication outside of struc-
tured, clinical settings are also necessary to assess how effectively speech-
related markers perform in practical, everyday situations. This insight is
crucial for developing tools that enable frequent and remote monitoring,
thereby facilitating ongoing management and treatment of PD.
Integration of additional factors alongside speech and language fea-
tureshasnotyetbeenthoroughlyinvestigated butcouldpotentiallyenhance
the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of PD. For instance, incorporating
extra information on early motor and non-motor symptoms, as well as
demographics, lifestyle and environmental risk factors, many of which are
often readily available oreasilymeasured, could furtherreﬁne the diagnostic
process.Combiningthesediverseelementscanhelpachieveamoreaccurate
assessment of PD, leading to better-informed diagnostic and management
strategies.
Finally, future research is required to uncover the pathogenesis of
speech and language deﬁcits and their associated risk proﬁles. While some
aspects of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms
in PD have been explored, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive.
The enhanced knowledge could provide valuable insights into a more
nuanced understanding of the overall disease onset and progression, facil-
itate the identiﬁcation of disease-modifying targets and improve early
intervention strategies.
In summary, PD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that poses a
signiﬁcant global health burden. Diagnosis currently hinges solely on the
presence of its key motor symptoms, which reﬂects considerable neuronal
damage and restricts the effectiveness of neuroprotective treatments. Early
detection of PD could be improved with the integration of speech-related
features,whichoftenappearearlyandprogresswiththedisease,allowingfor
timely intervention. Speciﬁc patterns of speech and language impairment
across different PD phenotypes could also aid in better patient classiﬁcation
and inform personalised clinical management strategies. Moreover, the
simplicity and low cost of speech analysis, combined with automated pro-
cessing on digital platforms, enable remote and frequent evaluations
accessible to a wider population. However, further research with larger
samples and a holistic approach is required to validate these preliminary
ﬁndings before clinical application.
