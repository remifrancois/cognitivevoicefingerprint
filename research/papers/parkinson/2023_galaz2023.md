Abstract
Background/Objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects both articulatory and phonatory
subsystems, leading to characteristic speech changes known as hypokinetic dysarthria.
However, few studies have jointly analyzed these subsystems within the same partici-
pants using interpretable deep-learning-based measures. Methods: Speech data from
the PC-GITA corpus, including 50 Colombian Spanish speakers with PD and 50 age-
and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed. We combined phonological feature
posteriors—probabilistic indices of articulatory constriction derived from the Phonet deep
neural network—with harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) as a laryngeal measure. Linear
mixed-effects models tested how these measures related to disease severity (UPDRS,
UPDRS-speech, and Hoehn and Yahr), age, and sex. Results: PD participants showed
significantly higher [continuant] posteriors, especially for dental stops, reflecting increased
spirantization and articulatory weakening. In contrast, [sonorant] posteriors did not dif-
fer from controls, indicating reduced oral constriction without a shift toward more open,
approximant-like articulations. HNR was predicted by vowel height and sex but did not
distinguish PD from controls, likely reflecting ON-medication recordings. Conclusions:
These findings demonstrate that deep-learning-derived articulatory features can capture
early, subphonemic weakening in PD speech—particularly for coronal consonants—while
single-parameter laryngeal indices such as HNR are less sensitive under medicated con-
ditions. By linking spectral energy patterns to interpretable phonological categories, this
approach provides a transparent framework for detecting subtle articulatory deficits and
developing feature-level biomarkers of PD progression.

1. Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
intracellular α-synuclein aggregation and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in
the substantia nigra pars compacta [1]. It is the second most common neurodegenerative
disease after Alzheimer’s and the fastest-growing neurologic disorder, affecting over six
million people worldwide [2]. While the principal clinical hallmarks are motor—resting
tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia—PD also entails a wide range of non-motor symp-
toms [1]. Among the most prevalent are speech and voice impairments, often manifesting
as hypokinetic dysarthria. Close to 90% of individuals with PD experience voice disorders,

while articulation and fluency problems occur in approximately 45% and 20% of cases,
respectively [3]. These impairments are pervasive and progressive and may even precede
the onset of motor symptoms [1].
Both laryngeal and supralaryngeal subsystems are affected in PD speech. At the
laryngeal level, speakers frequently produce incomplete vocal fold closures, spirantized
realizations (i.e., stops weakened toward fricatives), shortened stop closures, reduced
intraoral pressure, and abnormal voice-onset times (VOTs), with effects varying across
place of articulation and vowel contexts [4–15]. Evidence further suggested that coronal
consonants (produced with the tongue tip or blade, e.g., [t, d]) are disproportionately vul-
nerable in PD and related dysarthrias [8–10,16]. Vowel articulation is likewise compromised,
with reduced vowel space area, centralization of formants, and reduced consonant-vowel
coarticulation [17–21]. Traditional acoustic studies have relied on measures such as clo-
sure duration, VOT, and F1/F2 formants [13–15,22], while more recent approaches apply
computational methods ranging from recurrent networks trained to output phonological
feature posteriors (probabilities for features such as [continuant], distinguishing stops from
fricatives, or [sonorant], distinguishing obstruents from vowels/nasals/liquids) [23] to
broader learned embeddings [24,25], providing interpretable and data-driven indices of
articulatory categories.
At the laryngeal level, PD speech exhibits changes in both voice quality and prosody.
In complete glottal closure, asymmetrical vibration, and reduced respiratory drive yield
elevated jitter and shimmer, reduced cepstral peak prominence, and lower HNR [26–31].
Sustained vowels are often analyzed for this purpose, though continuous speech may
reveal similar information [32]. Prosodic abnormalities, including reduced pitch variability,
monoloudness, and altered timing patterns, are also widely reported [33]. Other studies
have explored prosody in relation to medication effects, differential diagnosis, and domain
specificity [34–36]. Taken together, these findings highlight PD speech as multidimensional,
with articulatory and phonatory deficits contributing in complementary but distinct ways.
Yet relatively few studies have jointly examined these subsystems in the same cohort or
directly modeled their relationship to clinical severity [6–8].
The present study addresses this gap by analyzing Colombian Spanish speech from
individuals with PD and matched controls, combining articulatory correlates (Phonet-
based posteriors) and acoustic correlate of phonation (HNR from sustained vowels). This
dual approach allows us to test whether different clinical scales are differentially sensitive
to articulatory versus phonatory decline, and to evaluate the potential of feature-based
representations for capturing PD speech impairments across subsystems.
2. Approaches to PD Speech Analyses
Research on PD speech has advanced along three complementary trajectories. Early
studies focused on handcrafted acoustic features, grounded in speech science and di-
rectly interpretable in terms of articulatory or phonatory mechanisms. More recent work
has shifted toward machine learning-based analyses, which automatically extract high-
dimensional patterns from the signal, offering scalability and strong classification perfor-
mance but often at the cost of interpretability. Bridging these two approaches, phonological
feature posteriors provide an intermediate framework that combines the representational
power of learned models with the transparency of linguistically motivated categories such
as [voice], [continuant], or [sonorant]. The subsections below review these major analytical
approaches to PD speech and situate the present study within this framework.

2.1. Overview of Analytical Approaches
Early analyses of PD speech relied on handcrafted acoustic measures that map cleanly
onto articulatory and phonatory mechanisms. Temporal indices such as VOT and clo-
sure duration, spectral cues such as vowel formants and vowel-space area, and voice-
quality metrics such as jitter, shimmer, HNR, and cepstral-peak prominence remain foun-
dational [17,28,37]. These interpretable features correlate with clinical severity—sustained-
vowel dysphonia measures significantly predict UPDRS scores [28], and vowel-space
reduction tracks disease progression and treatment response [16]. However, handcrafted
approaches require manual segmentation and typically evaluate cues in isolation, even
though PD speech reflects multidimensional reorganization. For instance, stop lenition
involves concurrent changes in intraoral pressure, closure duration, spectral tilt, and VOT,
while reduced prosodic variability arises from coupled shifts in F0 range, intensity, and
timing. Capturing such interdependent adjustments motivated the adoption of more
integrative computational frameworks.
Machine learning approaches extended these analyses by offering scalability and
automation. Early studies combined engineered features (e.g., MFCCs, formant- and
prosody-based statistics) with classifiers such as SVMs or random forests, achieving high
within-language accuracy for PD detection [38–40]. Large-scale reviews [41,42] confirmed
their diagnostic promise but highlighted barriers to generalization and limited physiolog-
ical interpretability. Subsequent deep-learning (DL) and self-supervised learning (SSL)
frameworks learned directly from spectrograms or raw waveforms [24,41]. Pretrained
models such as WavLM and Wav2Vec 2.0 improved robustness across corpora [43,44], and
newer architectures aligned SSL embeddings with interpretable articulatory or phonatory
streams [45,46]. While these models achieve strong accuracy, their “black-box” nature
limits clinical uptake, emphasizing the need for explainable representations that preserve
linguistic grounding.
Bridging interpretability and performance, phonological feature posteriors extend
acoustic analysis by reinterpreting the acoustic properties of the speech signal in
articulatory–phonological terms that reflect how features like [continuant] (degree of
oral constriction), [sonorant] (degree of vocal tract resonance), and [voice] (presence of
vocal-fold vibration) shape speech production. Neural networks trained to estimate the
probabilities of these features capture both categorical contrasts and gradient realiza-
tions [23]. This representation aligns naturally with processes like Spanish lenition—a
shift from [−continuant] to [+continuant] or [−sonorant] to [+sonorant]—which parallels
the articulatory weakening observed in PD speech [4,47]. By grounding learned mod-
els in articulatory principles, posterior-based approaches provide a transparent bridge
between acoustic analysis and clinical interpretation, motivating the use of Phonet—the
feature-posterior framework adopted in the present study.
2.2. Phonet
Phonet, first proposed by [23], operationalizes phonological posteriors by using neural
networks to estimate the probability that each short time frame expresses articulatory
properties such as [continuant], [sonorant], or [voice]. The model is phonologically mo-
tivated and language-specific, requiring a well-defined phonological feature set and a
segmentally aligned acoustic corpus (typically obtained via forced alignment). In contrast
to generic deep embeddings that yield opaque high-dimensional vectors, Phonet maps
acoustic information onto features with clear phonological interpretation, linking acoustic
variation directly to articulatory categories.
Technically, Phonet employs bidirectional recurrent neural networks with gated recur-
rent units (GRUs) trained on log Mel-filterbank energies from short spectral windows. This

architecture models context from both past and future frames, capturing coarticulatory
effects and temporal dependencies without requiring explicit duration measures. The
output is a sequence of posterior probabilities that reflect both categorical differences (e.g.,
stop vs. fricative) and gradient realizations (e.g., degrees of lenition).
While ref. [23] introduced Phonet as a general framework for pathological speech
analysis, early applications of phonological posteriors to Parkinsonian speech predate
Phonet. For example, ref. [48] used differential phonological posterior features to char-
acterize voice quality in PD, showing that these features could quantify breathy, creaky,
tense, falsetto, and harsh phonation components and predict dysarthria severity as rated
by the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment. More recently, ref. [49] applied the Phonet toolkit
directly to classify Spanish-speaking PD patients versus healthy controls, achieving high
classification accuracy and confirming the feasibility of using feature-level posteriors for
clinical assessment.
Phonet has since been validated and applied across multiple domains. It has been
used to quantify lenition in Spanish voiced stops [50–52], to model PD-related speech
impairments in Spanish [53], to characterize segmental drift in intoxicated speech [54]
and to track developmental phonetic changes in L2 Spanish learners [55]. Across these
applications, Phonet’s posterior outputs have proven to be a robust and interpretable index
of gradient articulatory variation, bridging neural modeling with linguistic theory and
clinical practice.
3. This Current Study
Most prior research on PD speech has focused either on segmental articulation or on
global voice quality, but rarely on both within the same dataset, and rarely using feature-
based methods that directly model phonological properties. Consequently, little is known
about how deficits in the supralaryngeal system (articulatory control of consonants) and
the laryngeal system (phonatory control of sustained vowels) unfold in tandem, or how
these deficits relate to clinical severity scales and demographic factors.
The present study addresses these gaps using speech from Colombian Spanish speak-
ers with PD and matched healthy controls.
We compare supralaryngeal measures—
continuant and sonorant posterior probabilities for stops—with a laryngeal measure (HNR)
for sustained vowels—across tasks and participant groups. By linking these measures to
UPDRS, UPDRS-speech, and Hoehn and Yahr scores, we test which clinical scales best
predict acoustic variation and whether articulatory and phonatory domains differ in their
sensitivity to disease progression. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive
account of PD-related deficits across representational levels, from segment-specific articula-
tory properties to laryngeal-phonatory control.
3.1. Research Questions and Hypotheses
Building on the evidence reviewed above, the study examines how supralaryngeal and
laryngeal speech measures relate to PD status and clinical severity. Our goals are twofold:
(i) to determine whether articulatory and phonatory deficits exhibit distinct patterns in
individuals with PD, and (ii) to assess which commonly used clinical rating scales are most
sensitive to these deficits.
RQ1. How do supralaryngeal measures—continuant and sonorant posterior probabilities for stop
consonants—and laryngeal measures—harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) for sustained vowels—differ
between PD participants and healthy controls, and are these group differences modulated by place
of articulation or vowel height? By focusing on speech-based articulatory measures, this study
complements prior work using nonspeech oral-motor tasks, which have shown limited ability to
predict consonant imprecision in PD [56].

H1. PD participants are predicted to produce stop consonants with higher continuant posterior
probabilities, reflecting greater lenition (i.e., spirantization of stops into fricatives). This prediction
is supported by kinematic evidence showing reduced amplitude and velocity of lower-lip and jaw
movements in PD during sentence-level speech [7] and scaled-down tongue movements and slower
vowel-related gestures in connected speech [6]. Phonological feature posteriors offer a promising,
interpretable way to quantify this articulatory hypokinesia in a manner that is both sensitive
and interpretable.
H2. PD participants are expected to produce sustained vowels with lower HNR values than healthy
controls, reflecting incomplete glottal closure and increased turbulent noise, as documented in
acoustic studies of dysphonia and PD speech [26,27]. Furthermore, analyses of sustained vowels
in both healthy and dysphonic speakers show that HNR tends to be lower for low vowels such as
/a/ and higher for high vowels such as /i/and /u/ [57,58], suggesting that vowel height modulates
periodic energy even in non-disordered speech. We therefore predict systematic vowel-height effects
on HNR, with larger PD-control differences for high vowels than for low vowels.
RQ2.
Which clinical severity metric—Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),
UPDRS-speech, or Hoehn and Yahr (H–Y) stage—most strongly predict variation in supralaryngeal
and laryngeal measures, and are these relationships influenced by participant age or sex?
H3. UPDRS-speech scores are expected to be the strongest predictors of supralaryngeal measures,
as this subscore specifically targets speech-motor function. The UPDRS speech item correlates
moderately with perceptual speech impairment across voice, articulation, prosody, and fluency
domains, indicating that it captures articulatory changes more sensitively than the overall UPDRS
total score [59].
H4. H–Y is expected to predict laryngeal measures (e.g., HNR) more strongly than supralaryngeal
ones, reflecting the effect of overall motor severity on glottal closure and phonatory stability. H–Y
stage has been shown to be significantly associated with global speech impairment [59] and to
substantially improve the variance explained in models of speech intelligibility when included as a
covariate (≈54% increase) [60]. Although a direct relationship between H–Y and HNR has not been
systematically reported, the documented influence of disease stage on phonatory measures makes
such an association plausible.
3.2. Materials and Methods
3.2.1. Data
Speech data were drawn from the PC-GITA corpus, a publicly available dataset of
Colombian Spanish speakers performing a range of speech-based tasks [61]. Participants
included 50 individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD; 25 men, 25 women) and 50 age- and
sex matched healthy controls, all native speakers of Colombian Spanish. Ages ranged from
33–77 years for men (PD M = 62.2 ± 11.2; controls M = 61.2 ± 11.3) and 44–75 years for
women (PD M = 60.1 ± 7.8; controls M = 60.7 ± 7.7) [61]. All PD participants were evaluated
by an expert neurologist and recorded in the ON-medication state (≤3 h after their morning
dose). Clinical ratings available in the corpus include the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rat-
ing Scale (UPDRS)—a multidimensional clinical scale of motor and non-motor symptoms,
with the speech subscore specifically evaluating voice, articulation, and prosody—and
the Hoehn and Yahr (H–Y) staging scale, which classifies disease severity from stage 1
(unilateral symptoms) to stage 5 (severe disability). These measures were used as predic-
tors in our analyses. At the time of recording, patients also received ratings according

to the MDS-UPDRS III [62], with an average score of 36.6, confirming moderate motor
involvement and ensuring clinical consistency of the dataset.
We analyzed data from three tasks: a sentence reading task targeting all six Spanish
stops (/p, b, t, d, k, g/); the “pataka” diadochokinetic (DDK) task targeting the three
voiceless stops; and a sustained vowel task in which participants produced each vowel
(/a, e, i, o, u/) three times for as long as possible. Table 1 provides counts of stop tokens
by group.

3.2.2. Measures
To assess how articulatory and phonatory deficits relate to disease progression, we
examined three standard clinical measures of PD severity: the UPDRS) [62], the UPDRS-
speech subscore, and the H–Y scale [63]. The UPDRS is a continuous measure ranging
from 0 to 200, based on 50 items that evaluate motor and cognitive abilities. Each item
is rated from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe), with higher totals reflecting greater impairment.
The UPDRS-speech is a single item within the UPDRS that specifically assesses volume,
modulation of prosody, and clarity, including slurring, palilalia, and tachyphemia, and is
scored on the same 0–4 scale. The Hoehn and Yahr scale is a widely used index of overall
disease progression scored from 0 to 5, with intermediate stages 1.5 and 2.5; values from
1 to 3 indicate mild to moderate disability, while values from 4 to 5 indicate moderate to
severe disability and loss of independence.
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of scores in PC-GITA. On the UPDRS, the mean
score was 37.7 (SD = 18.3, range = 6–93). The UPDRS-speech scores averaged 1.34 (SD = 0.82,
range = 0–2), indicating at most mild speech impairment. The H–Y scores averaged 2.19
(SD = 0.66, range = 0–4), which corresponds to bilateral involvement with early balance
difficulties but overall mild to moderate disability. These values indicate that participants
were largely in the early to middle stages of disease progression, with few scoring in the
severe range on any of the rating scales.

the [continuant] and [sonorant] features of the six stops was extracted for data analysis.
These features were chosen because they capture weakening of the oral constriction gesture,
the articulatory dimension most affected in PD. The feature [voice] was not included
because voicing contrasts in Spanish stops are largely context-dependent and therefore
not a reliable index of articulatory weakening in this dataset. Likewise, [nasal] was not
analyzed because the study focused on oral stops rather than nasal consonants. Thus,
[continuant] and [sonorant] provide a minimal, theory-consistent feature set optimized
for detecting gradient weakening of tongue gestures in stop production. HNR data were
gathered from Praat (v. 6.4.14) using a script [65]. Data was analyzed with linear mixed
effects models in R (4.4.1) [66]. Three separate models were fit with each of the neural
network outputs (continuant posterior probability, sonorant posterior probability, and
HNR) as the dependent variable. Fixed predictors included the three Parkinson’s disease
rating scales (UPDRS, UPDRS-speech, and Hoehn and Yahr), participant sex, and age. For
both posterior models, place of articulation (bilabial, dental, velar) was also included for
the HNR model, vowel height (open, mid, close) was included. Group (PD vs. control) was
not entered as a main effect because the clinical rating scales only apply to PD participants
and therefore collinear with group. However, interactions involving group and participant
factors (group × place, group × sex, group × age, and sex × age) were tested. Speaker
was included as a random slope to account for within-subject variability. Categorical
predictors were contrast-coded to ensure interpretable parameter estimates. Factors with
two levels (group, sex) were deviation-coded (values −0.5 and +0.5) such that the intercept
represented the grand mean and coefficients reflected deviations from it. Factors with more
than two levels (place, UPDRS speech, H–Y) were forward difference-coded, comparing
each level to the mean of subsequent levels. Continuous predictors (age and UPDRS scores)
were entered as continuous numerical variables.
4. Results
4.1. Continuant Posterior Probability
There was a significant main effect of age, with older participants exhibiting a higher
continuant posterior probability regardless of PD diagnosis (b = 0.660, SE = 0.002, t = 3.877,
p < 0.001), indicating a greater degree of lenition (spirantization). There was also an effect
of place, with bilabial (b = 0.381, SE = 0.090, t = 4.236, p < 0.001) and velar stops (b = −0.550,
SE = 0.090, t = −6.081, p < 0.001) produced with higher continuant posterior probabilities
than dental stops (Figure 1). However, this effect was modulated by an interaction between
group and place. Although neither group comparison reached significance, the pattern of
means differed: in the HC group, bilabial stops had slightly higher continuant posterior
probabilities than dental stops (b = 0.035, SE = 0.019, t = 1.869, p = 0.422), whereas in the
PD group, the pattern was reversed, with dental stops showing numerically higher values
than bilabials (b = −0.022, SE = 0.018, t = −1.208, p = 0.833) (Figure 2). This nonsignificant
trend may point to a greater susceptibility of tongue-tip articulations in PD, a possibility
that merits investigation in larger samples.
Among the clinical severity metrics, only the UPDRS-speech score significantly pre-
dicted continuant posterior probability. PD participants with a score of 1 produced stops
with lower continuant posterior probabilities than those with a score of 2 (b = −0.141,
SE = 5.189, t = −2.199, p = 0.031), indicating that more severe speech ratings were associated
with a stronger degree of lenition (Figure 3). Finally, there was a significant place × age
interaction. The slope of age-related change was steepest for dental stops, with continu-
ant posterior probability increasing more rapidly with age than for bilabials (b = −0.006,
SE = 0.001, t = −4.211 p < 0.001) or velar (b = 0.008, SE = 0.001, t = 6.109, p < 0.001), suggesting
that age-related lenition effects are most pronounced for tongue-tip articulations.

son’s diseases [PD]) and Stop Place of Articulation. Higher continuant probabilities indicate greater
spirantization, reflecting more fricative-like realizations of stops across places of articulation.
4.2. Sonorant Posterior Probability
The effect of place of articulation on sonorant posterior probability paralleled that
observed for continuant probability. Dental stops had lower sonorant posterior probabilities
than bilabials (b = 0.0203, SE = 0.086, t = 2.369, p = 0.018) or velar (b = −0.169, SE = 0.085,
t = −1.976, p = 0.048) stops (Figure 4). However, the place × group interaction revealed
a slightly different pattern than for continuant posteriors. In the healthy control group,
bilabial stops had significantly higher sonorant posterior probabilities than dental stops
(b = 0.054, SE = 0.018, t = 3.034, p = 0.029). In the PD group, however, this place-based
difference was not significant (b = −0.031, SE = 0.017, t = −1.801, p = 0.465). Although
the place effect for sonorants was weaker than for continuants, the pattern still suggests
relatively lower sonorant probabilities for dentals across groups, consistent with greater
articulatory constriction for tongue-tip gestures. When interpreted alongside the continuant
results, these findings suggest that PD speakers tend to lenite (spirantize) dental stops

toward fricatives (higher [continuant]) but not toward sonorants (no systematic increase in
[sonorant] probability).

fricative-like realizations of stop consonants with increasing speech-severity scores.

sonorant probabilities reflect more vowel- or approximant-like realizations of stop consonants.
Among clinical severity metrics, Hoehn and Yahr (H–Y) stage predicted sonorant pos-
terior probability, with a significant increase observed between levels 2.5 and 3 (b = −0.040,
SE = 0.220, t = −2.004, p = 0.048). A significant place × sex interaction was also observed:
among women, dental stops had higher sonorant posterior probabilities than velar stops
(b = 0.150, SE = 0.017, t = 8.790, p < 0.001), whereas no reliable place differences were
observed in men (b = 0.030, SE = 0.018, t = 1.652, p = 0.564) (Figure 5). Finally, a significant
place × age interaction was found, with dental sonorant values increasing more steeply
with age than bilabial (b = –0.003, SE = 0.001, t = −2.259, p = 0.024) or velar (b = 0.004,
SE = 0.001, t = 3.058, p = 0.002) stops (Figure 6).

4.3. Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio
Harmonics-to-noise ratio was significantly predicted by both vowel height and partic-
ipant sex. As expected, mid vowels had higher HNR values than low vowels (b = 3.960,
SE = 1.710, t = 2.316, p = 0.021), consistent with prior evidence that HNR increases with
vowel height [67]. Unexpectedly, women in our sample produced higher HNR values
than men (b = −12.516, SE = 5.481, t = −2.284, p = 0.025), despite previous reports that
men typically exhibit more harmonically rich voices [68] (Figure 7). The vowel-height
× sex interaction indicated that the sex difference was not significant for close vowels
(b = 1.732, SE = 0.770, t = 2.251, p = 0.224) but emerged for mid (b = 2.843, SE = 0.770,
t = 3.694, p = 0.005) and open vowels (b = 2.490, SE = 0.825, t = 3.020, p = 0.035), with women
showing higher HNR values than men for these vowel categories (Figure 8). These findings
partially support H2, confirming the expected vowel-height effect on HNR while revealing
sex-specific differences that may warrant further investigation.

5. Discussion
This study investigated how supralaryngeal and laryngeal speech measures differ-
entiate individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) from healthy controls and how these
measures relate to clinical severity ratings. By combining phonological feature posteriors
for stop consonants with harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) for sustained vowels, we jointly
analyzed articulatory and phonatory subsystems within a unified, interpretable framework.
Unlike categorical phone-based analyses or black-box embeddings, the feature-posterior
approach captures gradience in articulatory and phonatory control using phonologically
motivated dimensions such as [continuant] and [sonorant], which reflect how airflow and
constriction are coordinated during speech production.
Our findings support and extend previous evidence of articulatory weakening in
PD. Specifically, PD participants showed significantly elevated [continuant] posteriors for
stop consonants—particularly for dentals—consistent with increased spirantization, or

fricative-like realizations of oral stops. In contrast, [sonorant] posteriors did not differ
significantly from the healthy control group, indicating that the articulation changes re-
flects increased oral airflow through a still narrow constriction—consistent with turbulent,
fricative-like airflow—rather than a transition toward more open, vowel-like articulations
characteristic of approximants. This selective increase in [continuant]—without a cor-
responding rise in [sonorant]—suggests partial articulatory weakening consistent with
early-to-mid-stage PD, where oral closures are reduced but not fully lost. These effects
parallel aerodynamic findings of reduced intraoral pressure and incomplete stop closures
in PD (e.g., [4]) and complement kinematic evidence of reduced amplitude and speed of
tongue and jaw movements during both consonant and vowel production in PD [6].
Taken together, these results point to articulatory hypokinesia—a reduction in move-
ment magnitude and precision—leading to weaker constriction gestures and greater oral
airflow. Our feature-based analysis extends this literature by localizing the effect to tongue-
tip (coronal) gestures, which showed the steepest increase in [continuant] probability. This
place-specific vulnerability suggests that coronal articulations may serve as early indicators
of neuromotor decline.
Age-related effects followed a similar pattern, with dental stops exhibiting the
strongest increases in lenition with age. These findings align with prior proposals that
articulatory involvement in PD progresses from posterior to anterior oral regions [14]. The
fact that increased [continuant] posteriors appear in an on-medication, early-to-mid stage
cohort suggest that coronal instability may persist despite dopaminergic treatment—or that
feature posteriors are sensitive enough to detect subclinical weakening before overt articu-
latory errors emerge. In either case, our findings complement and extend [14]’s progression
hypothesis by identifying a potential early marker of anterior articulatory involvement.
Because posterior probabilities are continuous, they provide a quantitative, high-
resolution window into this biomechanical drift that may precede categorical misarticula-
tions. Importantly, this articulatory pattern is not language-specific: coronal consonants are
present in virtually all spoken languages and universally involve fine spatial and timing
control of the tongue tip. Thus, the heightened sensitivity of coronal articulations observed
here likely reflects a general biomechanical vulnerability of anterior tongue gestures, rather
than a Spanish-specific pattern.
As expected, vowel height was a strong determinant of HNR, with mid vowels show-
ing higher values than low vowels, and women exhibited higher HNR for mid and open
vowels. However, contrary to some previous reports, HNR did not differentiate PD from
controls or predict clinical severity in this early-to-mid-stage, ON-medication cohort. This
partial support for our second hypothesis suggests that vowel-intrinsic and demographic
factors dominate HNR variance under these conditions. Crucially, this null result should
not be taken to imply an absence of laryngeal involvement. Large-scale perceptual studies
have consistently found laryngeal impairment to be the most frequent and severe subsys-
tem deficit in PD, with [14] reporting glottal dysfunction in nearly 90% of their cohort and
often in isolation. A substantial body of acoustic work also demonstrates that phonatory
impairment can emerge as one of the earliest detectable signs of PD. Using a database of
sustained vowel phonations, [28] demonstrated that nonlinear dysphonia measures predict
UPDRS motor and total scores with clinically meaningful accuracy, highlighting the sensi-
tivity of glottal control as an early biomarker. Taken together, these findings indicate that
the lack of HNR differences in our study likely reflects methodological factors—particularly
the ON-medication recording state, which is known to partially normalize phonatory ir-
regularities and improve some aspects of phonation and voice quality—and the limited
diagnostic sensitivity of HNR as a single-parameter measure. HNR is influenced by vowel
type, F0 range, and analysis bandwidth and may therefore fail to capture subtle irregu-

larities when analyzed in isolation. Nevertheless, given that laryngeal deficits are among
the most frequently reported impairments in PD, the absence of HNR differences here
likely reflects individual and methodological factors—particularly disease-stage variability
and the ON-medication recording state—rather than the absence of phonatory involve-
ment. Longitudinal studies including OFF-medication recordings and multidimensional
phonatory indices would help clarify this relationship.
Medication-related variability further contextualizes these findings. The absence of
group differences in HNR should be interpreted in light of participants’ ON-medication
status. Recent studies examining the effects of levodopa on PD speech have yielded
mixed results: some report no significant OFF→ON changes in HNR or other hypokinetic-
dysarthria dimensions in early PD, even when limb motor scores improve [69], and no
benefit in late-stage PD despite motor improvement [70]. Others demonstrate partial nor-
malization of prosodic, respiratory, and spectral speech features following levodopa intake
and high classification accuracy for medication state using digital speech biomarkers [71].
Importantly, ref. [72] found that HNR improvements were strongest for /m/ and that
combining /a/, /o/, and /m/ yielded the best discrimination of medication state. Taken
together, these results suggest that the lack of HNR differences in our ON-medication co-
hort may reflect both dopaminergic attenuation of phonatory irregularities and the limited
sensitivity of single-vowel HNR to medication effects, which may emerge more robustly
in nasals, multiple phoneme contexts, or multidimensional acoustic measures. Future
work should therefore evaluate multidimensional phonatory indices (e.g., cepstral peak
prominence, spectral tilt, and glottal flow modeling), include OFF-medication recordings
or longitudinal follow-ups, and expand phonatory tasks to multiple phonemes to better
capture early-stage laryngeal dysfunction.
The contrast between our supralaryngeal and laryngeal findings also has implications
for models of disease progression. Classic work by [14] proposed that oral articulatory
involvement follows a posterior-to-anterior sequence, with tongue-tip dysfunction least
common and likely to emerge later in the disease course. Our results refine this framework
rather than contradict it. While numerous studies show that laryngeal impairment can
appear very early—even at prodromal stages—our findings suggest that subtle coronal
instability may arise in parallel with or shortly after these early phonatory changes, de-
spite dopaminergic treatment. In other words, feature-posterior measures may capture a
subclinical, pre-categorical stage of anterior articulatory weakening that precedes overt
errors and would be missed by perceptual assessment. If confirmed in longitudinal data,
this would extend the posterior-to-anterior progression model by adding an intermediate,
subphonemic phase of anterior decline, indicating that coronal consonants may serve as
sensitive early probes of supralaryngeal decline, complementing early laryngeal indicators.
The clinical analyses further clarify how these measures map onto disease severity.
Among the clinical predictors, the UPDRS-speech subscore emerged as the strongest
predictor of [continuant] posteriors, indicating that a speech-specific clinical rating aligns
most closely with articulatory performance, consistent with prior evidence linking UPDRS-
speech to acoustic and kinematic indices of articulatory control [73,74]. Hoehn and Yahr
(H–Y) stage showed a more localized effect, predicting increased [sonorant] posteriors at
the transition from stage 2.5 to 3. Because this stage marks the onset of bilateral motor
involvement and early postural change, this association may indicate that advancing motor
severity begins to affect oral constriction and voicing coordination. In contrast, neither H–Y
nor the global UPDRS predicted HNR in our data, underscoring the limited sensitivity of
global motor scales for detecting early, subtle phonatory change and highlighting the need
for speech-specific or multidimensional laryngeal metrics.

Finally, our choice of Phonet and phonological feature posteriors as the analytic frame-
work deserves emphasis. Unlike handcrafted acoustic cues that require segment-specific
definitions or opaque learned embeddings that sacrifice interpretability, feature posteriors
provide probabilistic, phonologically grounded indices by reinterpreting spectro-temporal
energy (log-Mel-filter bank inputs) in articulatory terms. This approach allowed us to disam-
biguate spirantization from approximantization, quantify place-specific vulnerabilities, and
trace age-related trajectories, all within a single unified representation. Methodologically,
feature posteriors offer a bridge between the richness of machine learning representations
and the interpretability required for clinical and linguistic applications. In doing so, they
support the development of compact, clinically meaningful speech biomarkers—such as
age-normalized dental [continuant] slopes—that can be deployed for telehealth monitoring
or early screening.
Several limitations should be acknowledged. The PD cohort was skewed toward early-
to-mid stages with limited UPDRS-speech variability (0–2), reducing the range of detectable
associations. All recordings were ON medication, likely attenuating both articulatory and
phonatory deficits. The stop dataset was unbalanced, with few /g/ tokens and no voiced
stops in the diadochokinetic task, constraining place contrasts. Additionally, because the
data were drawn exclusively from Colombian Spanish speakers, the findings may not fully
generalize to other languages or dialects with different stop inventories, phonotactic pat-
terns, or prosodic characteristics. Extending this approach to other corpora (e.g., PPMI, [75])
or using multilingual feature-extraction models could help evaluate the cross-linguistic
robustness of feature-posterior analyses. Finally, HNR as a single laryngeal measure is
coarse; richer multidimensional indices such as cepstral peak prominence, spectral tilt,
and glottal flow parameters should be incorporated in future studies. Addressing these
limitations in a longitudinal design will allow us to determine whether supralaryngeal
deficits consistently precede perceptible laryngeal ones, or whether the two systems exhibit
overlapping but dissociable timelines of decline.
6. Conclusions and Future Directions
To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to combine feature-based articulatory
and laryngeal measures in a single analysis of PD speech using the PC-GITA corpus. Our
results show that articulatory indices derived from phonological features—particularly
[continuant] posteriors for dental (tongue-tip) stops—are sensitive to both aging and PD-
related decline, correlating most strongly with the UPDRS-speech subscore. In contrast,
sustained-vowel HNR primarily reflected vowel-intrinsic and demographic variation, with
limited sensitivity to clinical severity in this ON-medication, early-to-mid stage cohort.
Together, these findings suggest that articulatory features may provide earlier or more
reliable markers of disease impact than single-parameter phonatory measures. Importantly,
they complement prior perceptual observations suggesting that subsystem involvement
may progress from laryngeal to oral articulators, highlighting the value of featural analyses
in detecting incipient articulatory instability even before categorical errors emerge.
Future work should expand this framework by incorporating a wider severity range,
OFF- and ON-medication recordings with sufficient washout, and longitudinal follow-ups
to track within-speaker trajectories over time. Task design should include balanced materi-
als across voiced and voiceless stops, connected speech, and multiple sustained-phonation
targets (e.g., /a/, /o/, and /m/) to maximize sensitivity to articulatory and phonatory
changes [72]. Laryngeal assessment should move beyond single-parameter HNR to multi-
dimensional indices such as cepstral peak prominence, spectral tilt, LTAS moments, and
glottal flow modeling, complemented by prosodic and respiratory measures that may be
more responsive to dopaminergic modulation [71]. Finally, integrating supralaryngeal

features with these multidimensional laryngeal and prosodic measures could yield a com-
posite speech-severity index aligned with UPDRS-speech, supporting remote monitoring,
early diagnosis, and evaluation of treatment effects. By situating feature-based analyses
at the interface of phonological representation and clinical assessment, this work lays the
foundation for more sensitive, interpretable, and clinically faithful speech biomarkers of
PD progression.
