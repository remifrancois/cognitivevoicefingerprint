Background: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an α-synucleinopathy characterized by prominent cerebellar or 
parkinsonian features. This is pathologically due to the deposition of α-synuclein in glial cells, the mechanism by 
which s not entirely clear. We describe three patients with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts later diagnosed with 
clinically established MSA, suggesting the co-existence of two rare pathologies through a shared mechanism 
versus by chance.
Cases: Patients ranged from 45 to 67 years of age at presentation, each describing 2–3 years of progressive 
symptoms. All displayed cerebellar findings and various non-motor features of orthostatic hypotension, geni­
tourinary failure, and dream enactment behavior confirmed on diagnostic testing or on a clinical basis. All 
imaging demonstrated posterior fossa arachnoid cysts and supportive features of MSA, notably pontine and 
cerebellar atrophy.
Conclusions: The probability of having both MSA and a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst based on population study- 
derived point prevalence and assuming independence of the events is 1.09 e-6. We suspect that while uncommon, 
concurrence of the diseases is due to chance. It is plausible that space-occupying lesions, when already present, 
may contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression.
Introduction
The diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) requires core fea­
tures of autonomic dysfunction and a predominant parkinsonian or 
cerebellar syndrome, as defined by the 2022 Movement Disorder Society 
(MDS) criteria (Wenning et al., 2022). Individuals with the parkinsonian 
subtype, or MSA-P, may exhibit bradykinesia, rigidity, or tremor, while 
those with the cerebellar subtype, or MSA-C, may exhibit gait or limb 
ataxia, cerebellar dysarthria, and oculomotor dysfunction (Wenning 
et al., 2022). Supporting MRI findings include atrophy or increased 
diffusion signal of the middle cerebellar peduncle, putamen, pons, and 
cerebellum (Wenning et al., 2022; Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 
2019). Symptoms typically arise in the 6th decade and often rapidly 
progress within 3 years (Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 2019). 
Prognosis is poor, with mean survival under 10 years from symptom 
onset in both MSA-P and MSA-C (Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 
2019; Low et al., 2015).
Pathologically, MSA is associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) aggrega­
tion with neuronal loss (Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 2019; Low 
et al., 2015). Several hypotheses regarding the abnormal intracellular 
collections of α-syn in MSA have been raised: α-syn overexpression, 
uptake of α-syn by glial cells, α-syn accumulation in response to 
glial-produced proteins, decreased or impaired α-syn degradation, 
“prion-like” spread of α-syn with various strains of different aggres­
siveness, and mitochondrial dysfunction and resultant inflammation 
(Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 2019). Multiple mechanisms may 
contribute to the degree of neuronal loss and clinical phenotype.
Arachnoid cysts are incidental findings found in 1.4 % of the popu­
lation (Al-Holou et al., 2013). There is limited evidence whether pos­
terior fossa cysts with mass effect may be associated with the 
development of a neurodegenerative disease (Bachstetter et al., 2021).
We describe three patients with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts and 
clinically established MSA. We calculate the probability of having both a 
posterior fossa arachnoid cyst and MSA by chance and describe possible 
relationships between the two pathologies.

dream enactment behavior. Other symptoms included emotional lability 
(sudden crying), new urinary urge incontinence otherwise not explained 
by MS, and constipation. Surveillance imaging over 6 years revealed a 
stable 8.3 × 2.9 cm posterior fossa arachnoid cyst and severe, progres­
sive olivopontocerebellar atrophy with a “hot cross bun” sign (Fig. 1). 
There was no evidence of new inflammatory lesions attributed to MS on 
imaging. Examination showed ataxic dysarthria, nystagmus, mild 
parkinsonism, with severe truncal and moderate appendicular ataxia. 
Thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) was abnormal with widespread 
anhidrosis (63.8 %) in a central pattern. Autonomic reflex screen was 
normal, though given unexplained urinary urge incontinence she met 
criteria for clinically established MSA-C.
Case 2. A 53-year-old man with autosomal dominant myotonia 
congenita presented with 2 years of progressive imbalance and ortho­
static hypotension with syncope. Other symptoms included several years 
of urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections, con­
stipation, erectile dysfunction, dream enactment behavior, dysphagia, 
and pseudobulbar affect. Examination showed hypophonic/spastic 
dysarthria, moderate parkinsonism, and moderate appendicular and gait 
ataxia. Imaging revealed pontine and cerebellar peduncle atrophy with a 
putaminal rim sign, and large posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (Fig. 2). TST 
showed global anhidrosis (94.5 %) in a central pattern, with acral and 
forehead preservation of sweating. Autonomic reflex screen showed 
severe cardiovascular adrenergic impairment and neurogenic ortho­
static hypotension. He was diagnosed with clinically established MSA 
and unfortunately died at the age of 54.
Case 3. A 45-year-old man presented with 2 years of progressive 
parkinsonism, urinary retention, and incontinence. Other symptoms 
included orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and stridor. Ex­
amination showed hypophonic/spastic dysarthria, moderate parkin­
sonism, and moderate axial and appendicular ataxia. Imaging showed 
moderate cerebellar atrophy and a small retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst 
(Fig. 3). Post-void residual was 400 cc. A skin biopsy was positive for 
α-syn at all sites. Autonomic testing at an outside hospital showed 
neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. He was diagnosed with clinically 
established MSA and unfortunately died at the age of 45.
Discussion
We present three patients with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts who 
were diagnosed with MSA, all with clinical cerebellar involvement.
Derived from a population study, the point prevalence rate for MSA 
at age ≥40 years is 7.8:100,000 and for posterior fossa arachnoid cysts 
is 1400:100,000 (Al-Holou et al., 2013; Bjornsdottir et al., 2013). 
Assuming the two events are independent, the probability of an indi­
vidual having both a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst and MSA by chance 
is 1.09 e-6. Using a United States population of 160.7 million for age 
≥40 years, we expect 175 cases of co-existent posterior fossa arachnoid 
cyst and MSA (Bureau, 2023).
This calculation shows that on a population level, concurrent pos­
terior fossa arachnoid cyst and MSA may be a chance event. A similar 
study evaluated the probability of a husband and wife both developing 
MSA, and despite an estimated 0.25 conjugal cases of MSA in the US and 
23 cases in the world, chance was the best explanation for their co- 
existence with possible contribution from shared exposures (Coon 
et al., 2019). While not indicative of causation, our case series raises the 
question of whether space-occupying lesions can contribute to the 
development or progression of neurodegenerative disorders. We pro­
pose that based on the probability calculation, it is more convincing that 
the two disorders occur together by chance. However, the presence of a 
cyst contributing to disease progression is plausible.
The development of tau astrocytopathy in the setting of long- 
standing arachnoid cysts has been reported (Bachstetter et al., 2021). 
It is proposed that chronic mechanical stress, as in repetitive trauma or 
space-occupying lesions, may result in degenerative changes of sur­
rounding astrocytes in patterns different from typical neurodegenerative 
diseases 
but 
manifesting 
in 
similar 
phenotypes. 
In 
alpha-synucleinopathies, inflammation and oxidative stress, as can be 
seen in chronic traumatic brain injury, has been shown to lead to the 
development of parkinsonian symptoms due to alpha-synuclein over­
expression (Acosta et al., 2015). Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is 
also associated with various types of neurotrauma and is characterized 
by perivascular deposition of phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary

tangles deep in cortical sulci, followed by spread of abnormal protein 
(McKee et al., 2015). Other proteins that are known to accumulate 
include 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein and amyloid beta. This pro­
tein deposition can lead to prominent behavioral change among other 
symptoms representing neurodegenerative disease depending on the 
location of accumulation and degree of spread. While the exact mech­
anism of protein deposition in unknown, it is proposed that repetitive 
stretch forces may damage blood vessels and axons in the area of 
trauma. Despite differences in the specific protein - α-syn in MSA – the 
mechanisms of protein aggregation and spread may be similar in 
patients with space-occupying lesions, with chronic alteration in local 
brain architecture.
Ninety-seven percent of retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts are asymp­
tomatic due to the ability of surrounding tissues to adjust and 
compensate for slow growth (Bachstetter et al., 2021). Symptoms of 
cranial neuropathies, headache, appendicular and gait ataxia, and 
cognitive and psychiatric changes have been described in adult and 
pediatric populations (Al-Holou et al., 2013). The degree of cerebellar 
symptoms and rate of progression in the three patients presented is felt 
to be due to MSA and out of proportion to what is expected from a

posterior fossa arachnoid cyst alone. In a series of only 3 patients, we 
cannot make conclusions on the rate of progression of disease. It is worth 
noting that the patient in Case 3 died within 2 years of disease onset, 
more rapid than the median survival from symptom onset to death 
(Monzio Compagnoni and Di Fonzo, 2019; Low et al., 2015).
The co-existence of two rare disorders suggests there may be a shared 
mechanism in their pathophysiology. While the most likely explanation 
for co-occurrence is chance, increased susceptibility to α-syn accumu­
lation and neuronal loss due to cerebellar and brainstem compression in 
the setting of an arachnoid cyst is an interesting concept. Further 
research can be done to better elucidate the relationship between space- 
occupying lesions and the development and progression of neurode­
generative disease.
