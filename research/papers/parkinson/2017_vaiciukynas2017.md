Purpose: This study aimed to explore the effects of motor impairments on different sides of the body at early onset 
in relation to voice acoustic performance in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Materials and methods: Participants were classified based on which side (left or right) experienced motor im­
pairments first, as well as the stage (early or late) of the disease. Hoehn-Yahr stages one and two were cate­
gorized as early-stage, while stages three and four were categorized as late-stage. Participants were divided into 
four groups: Group A, left-side early-stage conditions; Group B, left-side late-stage conditions; Group C, right-side 
early-stage conditions; Group D, right-side late-stage conditions. Participants performed three recording tasks 
that involved sustained phonation of the vowels/a/,/i/, and/u/. The study analyzed four acoustic parameters: 
Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), jitter, shimmer, and vF0.
Results: An Analysis of Variance revealed that for the acoustic parameters of /a/vF0 and /a/jitter, Group B 
performed significantly worse than Group A (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the other 
acoustic parameters or in MPT voice performance across the four groups.
Conclusions: The side of motor impairments at early onset is correlated with the severity of voice disorders. 
Notably, when impairments occur on the left side, the resulting voice disorders become more pronounced as the 
disease progresses.
1. Introduction
Progressive neurological diseases often significantly impact speech. 
One of the examples, Parkinson’s disease (PD), is a chronic degenerative 
disease of the central nervous system that is primarily characterized by 
motor function impairment and a wide range of non-motor symptoms. 
Hypokinetic dysarthria causes are unknown; they may be neural, 
physiological changes, or abnormal coordination across systems. 
Dysarthria is a speech-motor control disorder caused by damage to the 
central or peripheral nervous system, which leads to disrupted muscle 
control during speech production. This results in unclear articulation, 
hoarse voice quality, monotone speech, and other abnormalities. Motor 
speech disorders affect articulation, phonation, respiration, and reso­
nance due to motor dysfunction [1]. The study has shown that the 
control of force in complex motor sequences involving speech and limb 
movement is affected by a common deficit in the frontostriatal circuit 
[2]. Speech movements are complex behaviors. Although the organi­
zational mechanisms of speech and limb movements differ, speech and 
gait rhythm disorders have similar underlying pathomechanisms in 
patients with PD [3]. Both motor difficulties and speech disorders are 
considered axial symptoms of PD and share some common pathophys­
iological mechanisms [4]. A correlation was observed between gait 
impairment and oral diadochokinesis in patients with PD [5]. Similarly, 
the speech rate and walking speed of patients with PD were correlated 
[6].
In patients with PD, motor impairments typically begin on one side of 
the body and eventually affect both sides as the disease progresses. 
Studies indicate that the laterality of initial onset is linked to the tra­
jectory of symptom development and is essential for prognosis because 
the progression rate and incidence of secondary symptoms vary

depending on the side of motor impairment [7]. The study demonstrated 
that the initial laterality of motor impairment in patients with PD is 
related to the evolution of motor dysfunction severity and non-motor 
symptoms [8]. Furthermore, asymmetrical motor impairments in pa­
tients with PD are associated with lateralized brain activity. Specifically, 
patients with left-side motor impairments exhibit greater motor 
dysfunction variability than those with right-side impairments [9]. Pa­
tients with PD who exhibit lower availability of the left dopamine 
transporter (DAT) experience more severe dysarthria compared to those 
with lower right DAT availability [10]. Some research indicates that 
while levodopa improves general motor function, it doesn’t necessarily 
translate to significant improvements in speech [11–13]. For each dose 
of levodopa, the “ON” benefit typically lasts about 2–3 h on average 
[14]. To ensure consistency in the research, it was essential for partic­
ipants to complete their voice sample recordings within 2 h after taking 
the medication.
Various parameters of acoustic analysis have emerged as an 
increasingly utilized objective assessment method for studying speech 
disorders in patients with PD. Maximum phonation time (MPT) reflects 
the longest duration of phonation possible in a single breath, serving as 
an indicator of the function of respiration and phonation. The longer the 
MPT, the better the function of respiration and phonation. Jitter percent 
(%) measures the irregularity of the fundamental frequency period 
during phonation, indicating the degree of frequency perturbation, with 
higher values suggesting less stable voice quality. Shimmer percent (%) 
assesses the variation in the amplitude of vocal fold vibrations, with 
higher values indicating more significant fluctuations in voice volume. 
Lastly, fundamental frequency variation (vF0, %) represents the relative 
standard deviation of the fundamental frequency (F0), reflecting long- 
term variations in F0 across all analyzed speech samples. This study 
used acoustic analysis software to gather data on four acoustic param­
eters: jitter, shimmer, vF0, and MPT—during the production of the 
vowels /a/,/i/, and /u/.
Recent studies have shown that patients with PD exhibit higher 
values for specific vowel acoustic parameters, specifically jitter per­
centage and vocal fundamental frequency (vF0), compared to healthy 
controls [15]. These impairments were shown to worsen as the disease 
progressed. There has been extensive research on motor impairments 
and speech communication challenges in individuals with PD. However, 
to date, there have been no studies exploring how different-sided motor 
impairments at early onset impact voice acoustic performance in pa­
tients with PD. We believe this is a critical issue in preventing commu­
nication disorders for patients with PD.
2. Methods
2.1. Design
2.1.1. Participants
This study included 62 patients with primary PD, comprising 32 fe­
males and 30 males with a mean age of 69 years (SD = 9.21). Patients 
with PD were referred by a physician and diagnosed and confirmed as 
having primary PD in the department of neurology at a medical center. 
Informed consent was obtained from all of them. The patients with 
hearing impairment or cognitive factors were excluded. Hearing 
impairment was determined by failure in response to 512 Hz and 1024 
Hz tuning fork tests. The cognitive factor was determined when a Clin­
ical Dementia Rating (CDR) [16] score was equal to or greater than 1.
2.2. Measurement tools
2.2.1. Hoehn and Yahr scale (H & Y Scale)
The H & Y Scale is a commonly used system for clinically recording 
the level of symptoms of PD patients [17].
2.2.2. CDR
A CDR score of 0 indicates no dementia; 0.5 indicates undetermined 
or under observation; 1 indicates mild dementia; 2 indicates moderate 
dementia; 3 indicates severe dementia; 4 indicates profound dementia; 
and 5 indicates terminal dementia [16].
2.2.3. Multidimensional voice program (MDVP)
This study conducted an acoustic analysis using the MDVP (Model 
5101). There are several software programs used in analyzing the voice, 
of which MDVP is currently used in routine clinical practice. It is com­
mented that MDVP is the most widely used software for the acoustic 
analysis of voice globally [18].
2.3. Research procedure
The study procedure involved participants reporting the side (left or 
right) where movement impairments first experienced at early onset, 
which was confirmed and recorded by neurologists. Then, neurologists 
assessed the stage of motor impairments using the H&Y scale, and 
cognitive function was evaluated using the CDR scale.
This study classified participants based on which side (left or right) 
experienced motor impairments first, as well as the stage of the disease 
(early or late). H&Y stages one and two were categorized as early-stage 
disease, while stages three and four were classified as late-stage disease. 
Participants were divided into four groups: Group A, left-side early-stage 
conditions; Group B, left-side late-stage conditions; Group C, right-side 
early-stage conditions; and Group D, right-side late-stage conditions, 
as detailed in Table 1.
The researchers collected speech samples in a quiet, private space. 
The speech samples included three recording tasks that involved the 
sustained phonation of the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/. This study analyzed 
four acoustic parameters: MPT, jitter, shimmer, and vF0. All recordings 
of participants were conducted one hour after medication and 
completed within two hours of drug administration. The background 
noise in the recording space was kept below 30 dB. Speech samples were 
captured with a portable high-resolution digital recorder (Tascam, DR- 
07), placed at a distance of 15 cm from the participants to ensure the 
stability of speech sample volume and voice quality. Each recording 
session lasted approximately 5 minutes.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Data analyses were performed using SPSS Version 20. The signifi­
cance level p was set at 0.05. This study analyzed the data using a one- 
way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests (Tukey’s HSD) to control for 
multiple comparisons.

3. Results
An Analysis of Variance revealed that for the acoustic parameters of 
/a/vF0 and /a/jitter, Group B performed significantly worse than Group 
A (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the other acoustic 
parameters or in MPT voice performance across the four groups. 
Detailed statistical data are presented in Tables 2–4.
4. Discussion
The study findings indicated that there were no significant differ­
ences in MPT performance among the four groups of patients with PD. 
This suggests that the control of respiration and phonation may not be 
significantly affected by the progression of the disease or by laterality. 
Previous research has shown that many healthy older adults can phonate 
for at least 20 seconds. In our study, although there was no significant 
difference in MPT among the four groups of PD subjects, the average 
duration was found to be less than 20 s. MPT is a vital clinical tool for 
assessing phonation and respiratory muscle function. A reduction in 
MPT among patients with PD indicates compromised respiratory func­
tion, highlighting the importance of maintaining MPT to prevent dete­
rioration of lung function and related complications. A study noted that 
reduced MPT often occurs alongside low vocal intensity and limited 
prosodic range in both neurologic and aging populations, which can 
restrict audibility and expressive nuance in everyday communication 
[19].
The vF0 % is a voice stability indicator based on sustained vowels. A 
high vF0 % may indicate reduced neuromuscular control, develop­
mental immaturity in children, certain pathological conditions, or 
compensatory behavior [20]. Clinically, differences in vF0 % are often 
used to assess vocal changes related to age and specific neurological 
conditions. Jitter % commonly used in clinical acoustic examinations 
reflects the control of vocal fold vibration [21]. Jitter % specifically 
measures the micro-instability of the vocal fold vibrations, which are the 
source of sound in the voice. Elevated jitter % signals unstable vocal fold 
vibration and is associated with rough/hoarse quality and higher overall 
dysphonia ratings. High jitter % are often indicative of voice pathol­
ogies, such as roughness, hoarseness, or breathiness, due to irregular 
vocal fold vibration [20]. A systematic literature review indicated that 
jitter % is significantly elevated in patients with PD [20].
A study reported that healthy elderly individuals, aged 62 to 75, had 
average values of 2.327 for /a/-vF0 and 1.508 for /a/-jitter [20]. In 
contrast, Group A showed lower performance for the vowel /a/, with 
values of 1.999 for vF0 and 1.281 for jitter. Meanwhile, Group B 
exhibited significantly higher values, with 8.860 for vF0 and 2.963 for 
jitter, surpassing those of the healthy elderly individuals. Therefore, 
patients with PD who initially experienced movement impairments on 
the left side have their voice disorders progress rapidly. On the other 
hand, the average values of /a/-vF0 in Groups C and D were 4.485 and 
3.998, respectively, while the /a/-jitter values were 1.797 and 1.877, 
respectively. Although these values were higher than those found in 
healthy elderly adults, the differences were not significant. This 
indicates that patients with PD who initially experienced movement 
impairments on the right side tend to have a slow progression of voice 
disorders. In comparison, /a/-simmer in healthy elderly adults was 
6.670, and for the four groups of PD patients were 4.573, 6.117, 6.002, 
and 4.846, respectively, all of which fall within the normal range of 1.65 
to 6.73 [20].
Voice acoustic analysis is a valuable clinical tool for detecting 
changes in voice disorders in patients with PD. However, previous re­
ports on acoustic analysis have produced inconsistent results, likely due 
to the failure to account for the lateralization of motor impairments that 
patients initially experienced. Therefore, future evaluations of voice 
disorders in patients with PD should consider the laterality of motor 
impairments at early onset as a predictive factor for the development of 
voice disorders.
This study included participants from a medical center in the 
southern region of Taiwan, which may have limitations due to specific 
Mandarin and cultural factors. Future research will aim to increase the 
sample size by including participants from a variety of Mandarin dialects 
and cultures.
5. Conclusions
Speech is essential for maintaining a good quality of life, highlighting 
the urgent need for early and objective diagnostic markers. This study 
found no significant differences in the acoustic parameters between the 
early and late stages of the disease in patients with PD who have right- 
side motor impairments at the early onset. This suggests that voice dif­
ficulties progress relatively slowly in these patients. In contrast, patients 
with PD who have left-side motor impairments at the early onset showed 
significant differences in voice disorders between the early and late 
stages of the disease, indicating a rapid deterioration of voice difficulties 
in these patients. Therefore, future speech therapy should take into ac­
count the influence of motor impairment laterality at the early onset in 
patients with PD.
