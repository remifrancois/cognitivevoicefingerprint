Abstract
The de novo generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the peripheral immune compartment
and the differentiation of Th17 cells both require TGF-β, and IL-6 and IL-21 are switch factors that
drive the development of Th17 cells at the expense of Treg generation. The major vitamin A
metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) not only enforces the generation of Treg but also inhibits the
differentiation of Th17 cells. Here we show that RA enhances TGF-β signaling by increasing the
expression and phosphorylation of Smad3 and this results in increased Foxp3 expression even in the
presence of IL-6 or IL-21. RA also inhibits the expression of IL-6Rα, IRF-4 and IL-23R and thus
inhibits Th17 development. In vitro, RA significantly promotes Treg conversion but in vivo during
the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) it does not increase the
frequency of Treg cells in the face of an ongoing inflammation. However, RA suppresses the disease
very efficiently by inhibiting proinflammatory T cell responses, especially pathogenic Th17
responses. These data not only identify the signaling mechanisms by which RA can affect both Treg
and Th17 differentiation, but also highlight that in vivo during an autoimmune reaction, RA
suppresses autoimmunity mainly by inhibiting the generation of effector Th17 cells.

Introduction
Proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cells have long been linked to the induction of organ
specific autoimmune diseases (1). However the fact that loss of IFN-γ or lack of IFN-γ signaling
results in increased susceptibility rather than resistance to autoimmunity has led to the
hypothesis that a T cell subset other than Th1 cells might be crucial in the induction of
autoimmunity (2). This observation provided the impetus for the identification of a new subset
of effector T cells called Th17 cells, which produce the hallmark cytokine, IL-17A (also called
IL-17). Th17 cells are highly proinflammatory cells, and emerging data suggest that they
orchestrate tissue inflammation and organ-specific autoimmune diseases (3). On the other
hand, CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ T cells which express Foxp3
and are important in inhibiting inflammation and mediating self tolerance (4). Therefore, Treg
and Th17 cells antagonize functions of each other, whereas Th17 cells are crucial for inducing
tissue inflammation and autoimmunity, Treg cells prevent tissue inflammation, autoimmunity
and mediate self tolerance (5).
Treg cells are normally generated in the thymus upon contact with self-antigen (natural Treg,
nTreg) and seeded to the peripheral immune compartment, where they regulate immune
responses through out the life span of the individual (4). Treg cells can also be induced in the
peripheral immune compartment by conversion of naïve CD4+ T cells into Foxp3+ T cells by
TGF-β (induced Treg, iTreg) (4). TGF-β also supports the maintenance of Foxp3 expression
and suppressive function of nTreg cells (6). TGF-β signals by binding its cell surface serine/
threonine kinase receptors, which in turn phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated
Smad2 and Smad3, together with Smad4, enter the nucleus to regulate the expression of target
genes, either directly or in association with other transcription factors (7). A number of factors
have been identified to be able to enhance or inhibit the TGF-β mediated conversion of Treg
cells. Cytokines (like IL-6 and IL-21) and various metabolites, such as retinoic acid, have been
shown to regulate the conversion of TGF-β mediated Foxp3+ Treg cells (8,9). IL-6, an acute
phase protein induced early during inflammation, has been shown to suppress TGF-β mediated
Foxp3 induction but in turn induce the generation of Th17 cells from differentiating naïve T
cells (3). IL-6 binds its cell surface receptors, IL6Rα and a shared common receptor gp130, to
recruit and phosphorylate STAT3 (9). IL-6 or IL-21 in combination with TGF-β, induces the
expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt in T cells, a transcription
factor important for the development of Th17 cells (9). RORγt also upregulates the expression
of IL-23R, and engagement of IL-23R by IL-23R further induces RORγt expression and
reinforces and stabilizes the development and function of Th17 cells (3,9,10).
In addition to RORγt, interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a transcription factor induced by
TcR/CD3 signaling, has recently been reported to be also required for Th17 differentiation
(11). Lack of IRF4 in CD4+ T cells led to decreased RORγt expression and IL-17 production
with an associated defect in Foxp3 downregulation in Th17 cultures, due to a reduced IL-6
response. However, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 is normal in IRF4-/- cells,
suggesting that the downstream events of STAT3 phosphorylation in the IL-6 signaling
pathway are impaired in the absence of IRF4.
Retinoic acid (RA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A that regulates various cellular functions
such as proliferation, differentiation and cell death in a variety of cell types through two specific
families of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RAR, including α, β and γ subtypes)
and the retinoic X receptors (RXR, also including α, β and γ subtypes), which function as
ligand-inducible transcription factors (12-15). All-trans-RA binds preferentially to RAR,
whereas 9-cis-RA binds to both RAR and RXR (12,13). In the immune system, RA plays
important roles in regulating the functions of various types of immune cells (15). For example,
RA prevents activation-induced cell death of T cells and inhibits Th1 but enhances Th2

responses (16,17). RA in vivo suppresses inflammatory responses and tissue damage and
ameliorates a variety of autoimmune diseases in animal models, including experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, inflammatory
bowel disease, and lupus (18-22). However, the beneficial effect of RA in these diseases was
so far thought to be due to its inhibition of Th1 responses. A number of recent reports have
demonstrated that RA produced by CD103+ DC in the gut preferentially induces iTreg cells
(23-26) but inhibits Th17 differentiation (26) and this may be one of the mechanisms by which
RA suppresses autoimmune reactions in vivo. However, the biochemical and molecular
mechanism by which RA promotes iTreg conversion and suppresses Th17 cell generation has
not been addressed.
Here we report that RA indeed affects both Treg conversion and Th17 differentiation by
influencing the components of TGF-β, IL-6/IL-21, and TcR/CD3 signaling pathways, which
are involved in the development of Th17 and Treg cells. Interestingly, although RA in vitro
dramatically enhances the development of Treg cells, RA in vivo does not increase the
frequency of Treg cells significantly in an autoimmune disease setting but mainly inhibits the
generation of effector T cells. We conclude that the beneficial effect of RA in autoimmunity
is mainly due to its inhibition of pathogenic Th17 responses.
Materials and Methods
Mice and reagents
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Foxp3gfp.KI mice were
generated and maintained as described previously (32). Mice were maintained and all animal
experiments were done according to the animal protocol guidelines of Harvard Medical School.
MOG35-55 peptide was synthesized by Quality Controlled Biochemicals and was > 80% pure,
as determined by HPLC. ATRA and DMSO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ATRA (100
mM) was solved in DMSO (Vehicle) and stored at -80 °C as aliquots before use. All of the
fluorescence-conjugated antibodies were obtained from eBioscience and BD Biosciences. All
of the antibody pairs for ELISA were purchased from BD Biosciences. All cytokines were
purchased from eBiosciences and R&D Systems.
Naïve CD4+ T cell purification and stimulation
Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD62Lhi CD25-) were purified by FACS-sorting following a
MACS bead-isolation of CD4+ cells. Naïve CD4+ cells were activated with plate-bound anti-
CD3 (2 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml) in 96-well plates. ATRA (10 nM) was included
in the cultures. Cultures were also supplemented with IL-6 (20 ng/ml), IL-21 (200 ng/ml), IL-6
(20 ng/ml) or IL-21 (200 ng/ml) plus TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for Th17 cell differentiation, and TGF-
β (2 ng/ml) for Treg conversion.
Flow cytometry
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated in culture medium containing PMA
(30 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (500 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and monensin (GolgiStop,
1 μl/ml, BD Biosciences) in a cell incubator with 10% CO2 at 37 °C for 4 h. After staining
surface markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm and Perm/Wash
buffer (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, cells were stained
with fluorescence-conjugated cytokine antibodies at 25 °C for 30 min before analysis. In most
of the staining experiments, if possible, 7-AAD (BD biosciences) was also included to gate
out the dead cells. MOG tetramer staining has been described previously (32,42). All data were
collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).

RNA isolation, real-time PCR and Western Blot
Total RNA isolation, Taqman Quantitative PCR and Western blot were performed as described
previously (42,43). All primers and probes for real-time PCR were purchased from Applied
Biosystems.
Immunization and EAE evaluation
Female B6 mice (8-12-wk old) were immunized subcutaneously in the flanks with an emulsion
containing MOG35-55 (100 μg/mouse) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra extract (3 mg/
ml, DIFCO) in CFA (100 μl/mouse). Pertussis toxin (100 ng/mouse, List Biological
Laboratories) was administered intraperitoneally on days 0 and 2. RA was intraperitoneally
injected every other day (450 μg/mouse/time point). Mice were monitored and assigned grades
for clinical signs of EAE using the following scoring system: 0, healthy; 1, limp tail; 2, impaired
righting reflex or waddled gait; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, total limb paralysis; 5, moribund or
death.
Proliferation assay and ELISA
Draining lymph node cells were isolated from treated mice and plated in round-bottomed 96-
well plates (BD Biosciences) in culture medium with various concentrations of antigen. After
48 h, plates were pulsed for 16 h with 1 μCi [3H]-thymidine per well. Proliferation was
measured as counts per minute by using a Wallac Liquid Scintillation Counter (Perkin Elmer).
Cytokine production in the supernatant of cell cultures was measured by ELISA as described
previously (42,43).
Statistics
The clinical score and incidence of EAE were analyzed by Fisher's exact test, and other
comparisons were analyzed by Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Differential effects of RA on the development of Th17 and Foxp3+ Treg cells
TGF-β plays an important role in Foxp3+ Treg conversion and together with IL-6 or IL-21, in
Th17 development (27,28). Several recent studies have shown that RA synergizes with TGF-
β to induce iTreg cells (23-26) and reciprocally inhibit development of Th17 cells induced by
TGF-β plus IL-6 (26). To understand the mechanism by which RA enhances iTreg conversion
and inhibits Th17 differentiation, we first studied whether RA would affect the TGF-β-induced
development of Foxp3+ Treg and Th17 cells. Naive CD4+ T cells were activated with anti-
CD3 and anti-CD28 plus TGF-β, under these conditions 55% of T cells became Treg cells, as
measured by Foxp3 expression (Figure 1A). Addition of RA further increased the frequency
of Foxp3+ Treg cells (78%). In the absence of TGF-β, RA did not induce any Foxp3 expression
(Figure 1B). Similarly, whereas TGF-β plus IL-6 or IL-21 induced IL-17, RA alone or in
combination with IL-6 or IL-21 had no effect on IL-17 production. However, RA inhibited
both TGF-β plus IL-6- and TGF-β plus IL-21-induced IL-17 production (Figure 1B). In both
cases, the inhibition of IL-17 by RA was associated with an increased expression of Foxp3
suggesting that RA inhibited the capacity of both IL-6 and IL-21 to suppress the induction of
Foxp3 by TGF-β. As reported previously (18), RA also strongly inhibited IFN-γ production in
the neutral T cell differentiation conditions (Th0). These data indicate that although RA alone
does not affect either IL-17 or Foxp3 expression, RA can enhance TGF-β-induced Foxp3+
Treg conversion and reciprocally inhibit IL-6- and IL-21-induced Th17 differentiation in a
TGF-β dependent manner.

RA enhances the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3 but not Smad2 in the presence
of TGF-β
TGF-β signals through Smad2 and Smad3 to regulate various target genes including Foxp3
(7). Therefore, we examined whether RA affected Smad2 and Smad3 transcription during Treg
conversion. As shown in Figure 2A, RA did not affect the TGF-β-induced expression of
Smad2 mRNA. In contrast, RA clearly increased the TGF-β-induced expression of Smad3
mRNA.
We then determined the levels of total and phosphorylated Smad (p-Smad) proteins by Western
blot. Neither expression nor phosphorylation of Smad2 was affected by RA in any condition,
whereas the TGF-β-induced expression of Smad3 and its phosphorylation (p-Smad3) were
markedly increased in the presence of RA (Figure 2B). RA alone apparently increased the
expression of Smad3 but had no effect on its phosphorylation (Figure 2B). These data suggest
that RA in the presence of TGF-β specifically enhances the expression and phosphorylation
of Smad3, which then upregulates the expression of target genes including Foxp3
RA inhibits TGF-β-induced expression of IL-6Rα
Besides inducing Smad3 and Foxp3, RA also inhibited the generation of Th17 cells by TGF-
β plus IL-6. We wanted to determine whether the increase in TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression
was sufficient to explain Th17 inhibition. Thus, we analyzed IL-6 signaling in the presence of
RA. First, we determined whether RA affected the expression of IL-6 receptors.
IL-6 receptors consist of the IL-6Rα and gp130 subunits. Interestingly, TGF-β but not IL-6 or
IL-21 upregulated the expression of both IL-6Rα and gp130 mRNA in CD4+ T cells (Figure
3A). TGF-β-induced gp130 upregulation was not affected by RA. However, RA strongly
inhibited the upregulation of IL-6Rα mRNA by TGF-β (Figure 3A). Consistent with the
quantitative PCR data, surface expression of IL-6Rα on CD4+ T cells was upregulated by TGF-
β, which was blocked by RA (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in the condition where
RA was included together with TGF-β plus IL-21 (data not shown). Collectively, these data
suggest that the RA-mediated inhibition of Th17 differentiation not only relates to an increased
Foxp3 expression, but also to blocking of the TGF-β-induced upregulation of the IL-6Rα and
thus prevention of IL-6 signaling.
Effect of RA on STAT3 phosphorylation, IL-21 production, and IL-23R expression during Th17
differentiation
Naive CD4+ T cells activated by IL-6 secrete IL-21 through STAT3. In concert with TGF-β,
IL-21 induces RORγt and IL-17 expression. IL-21, which amplifies its own production by an
autocrine feedback loop, also acts upstream of RORγt mainly through STAT3 to induce the
expression of IL-23R. Engagement of IL-23R by IL-23 induces further RORγt expression and
stabilizes the Th17 phenotype (3,9,10). Given that RA inhibited TGF-β-induced upregulation
of IL-6Rα, we then examined whether RA could directly influence downstream components
of the IL-6 signaling pathway.
We first examined STAT3 phosphorylation (p-STAT3) induced by IL-6 in the presence of RA.
After 30 min, neither TGF-β nor RA affected IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure
4A). Because the effect of RA may not be achieved as early as 30 min, we therefore determined
STAT3 phosphorylation after longer treatments. After 24h-culture, a sustained level of p-
STAT3 was observed by the treatment with IL-6 alone, this level was further increased in the
presence TGF-β (Figure 4A), which is in agreement with the observation that TGF-β could
upregulate the expression of IL-6 receptors. After 24h, RA still did not affect IL-6 or IL-21-
induced STAT3 phosphorylation irrespective of whether or not TGF-β was present. Notably,
unlike in the condition with IL-6, addition of TGF-β did not increase IL-21-induced STAT3

phosphorylation, indicating that TGF-β may not affect the expression of the IL-21 receptor.
However after 48h culture, RA decreased the IL-6 plus TGF-β-driven enhancement of p-
STAT3 to the level obtained with IL-6 alone (Figure 4A). These data demonstrate that while
TGF-β enhances IL-6-induced p-STAT3 by upregulating the expression of IL-6 receptor
subunits, this enhancement is inhibited by RA. The data also illustrate that although RA
decreases the level of p-STAT3 induced by IL-6 plus TGF-β, it does not inhibit STAT3
phosphorylation induced by IL-6 alone, IL-21 alone or IL-21 plus TGF-β (Figure 4A). Taken
together, these data suggest that RA is unlikely to directly affect IL-6- or IL-21-mediated
STAT3 phosphorylation. Instead, RA can indirectly decrease the level of IL-6-induced p-
STAT3 in the presence of TGF-β by inhibiting the TGF-β-induced upregulation of IL-6Rα.
We next examined the IL-6- and IL-21-induced IL-21 expression in the presence of RA. As
shown in Figure 4B, both IL-6 and IL-21 enhanced expression of IL-21 mRNA. However, IL-6
is a stronger inducer of IL-21 than IL-21 itself. Addition of RA did not affect the expression
of IL-21 mRNA or IL-21 protein (Figure 4B).
Both IL-6 and IL-21 induce IL-23R expression and both IL-6-induced and IL-21-induced
expression of IL-23R is independent on TGF-β (29). However, irrespective of the stimulation
condition, the expression of IL-23R is dependent on the transcription factor RORγt. As the
expression of RORγt has been shown to be decreased in the presence of RA (26,30), we
predicted that the expression of IL-23R would also be decreased by RA treatment. Indeed, the
expression of IL-23R was strongly suppressed by RA irrespective of whether T cells were
activated in the presence of IL-6 alone or IL-6 plus TGF-β. RA similarly inhibited the IL-23R
expression when incubated with IL-21 alone or TGF-β plus IL-21, although the IL-23R
upregulation with IL-21 was much lower than that with lL-6 (Figure 4C).
RA decreased IRF4 expression in both Th17 and Treg cell cultures
Given that IRF4, a transcription factor induced by TcR/CD3 signaling, is also required for
Th17 differentiation (11), we studied the effect of RA on IRF4 expression during the
development of Th17 and Treg cells. When RA was added to the stimulation cocktail, a
significant decrease of IRF4 expression could only be observed in conditions containing TGF-
β. RA did not affect IRF4 expression under Th0 condition or conditions containing IL-6 or
IL-21 alone (Figure 5). These data suggest that RA downregulates IRF4 expression through
cooperating with TGF-β signaling, which is TGF-β dependent.
In vivo treatment with RA decreased antigen-specific Th17 and Th1 responses but had only
minor effects on the Foxp3+ Treg population
RA enhanced TGF-β-induced Foxp3+ Treg cell conversion but reciprocally inhibited TGF-β
plus IL-6/IL-21-induced Th17 cell differentiation in vitro. Therefore, we next examined in
vivo effects of RA on T cell responses and the development of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), which serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis (31). EAE
is mediated by myelin-reactive Th17 and Th1 cells, and Treg and Th2 cells have been shown
to inhibit EAE (5,31). From our in vitro data we predicted that RA would increase the Treg
population but decrease encephalitogenic Th17 responses and thus inhibit development of
EAE.
We first determined the effect of RA on the development of antigen-specific effector T cell
responses. Foxp3gfp.KI mice were immunized with MOG35-55/CFA and intraperitoneally
treated with RA in corn oil every other day starting from day 0. On day 10, draining lymph
node (LN) cells from these MOG35-55-immunized Foxp3gfp.KI mice treated with RA were
tested for T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Compared to vehicle treated animals,
cells from RA-treated mice showed decreased proliferation upon antigen restimulation in

vitro (Figure 6A). In line with the decreased proliferation, RA dramatically inhibited the
production of IL-17 as well as IFN-γ upon antigen specific restimulation, suggesting that RA
strongly inhibited the priming/expansion of pathogenic Th17 and Th1 responses in vivo.
However, the decrease of IFN-γ and IL-17 in the culture supernatants may reflect a decrease
in the production of these effector cytokines or a decrease in the frequency of IL-17- and IFN-
γ-producing T cells. By intracellular cytokine staining we could clearly see a decreased
frequency of IL-17- and IL-17/IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in RA treated mice (Figure 6B).
Furthermore, we found that CD4+ T cells from RA-treated mice showed a strong reduction of
IL-23R mRNA expression but no change in IL-21 mRNA expression (Figure 6C) thus
corroborating the in vitro data. These data suggest that the reduced Th17 response was also
partly due to the decreased expression of IL-23R after RA treatment in vivo.
We then analyzed the in vivo effect of RA on Treg cells in these immunized Foxp3gfp.KI mice,
which allow us to track Foxp3+ Treg cells based on GFP expression (32). We determined the
frequency of Foxp3/GFP+ cells among CD4+ T cells in different lymphoid compartments on
day 10 after immunization. Surprisingly, RA treatment only slightly increased the frequency
of Foxp3+ Treg cells among CD4+ T cells in the spleen and peyer's patches but not in cervical
and axillary, inguinal or mesenteric lymph nodes from MOG35-55-immunized mice (Figure
7A). Furthermore, the MOG35-55/IAb tetramer staining demonstrated that RA treatment did
not increase the frequency of tetramer-reactive MOG35-55-specific Foxp3+ Treg cells.
However, RA treatment inhibited dramatically the frequency of antigen-specific effector T
cells and therefore reduced the ratio of MOG35-55-specific effector T versus Treg cells (Figure
7B).
We have shown that IL-6 inhibits the generation of iTreg cells and in MOG/CFA immunized
mice or under strongly inflammatory conditions (in the presence of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β),
antigen specific Treg cells are not generated de novo but are derived from nTreg cells (32).
Therefore, we first determined the effect of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β on the generation of
Foxp3+ iTreg cells induced by TGF-β. As an inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 showed a stronger
inhibitory capacity in TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression than IL-21, although both cytokines
could induce the production of IL-17, which was dramatically inhibited by RA treatment
(Figure 7C). However, addition of all the inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β)
into Th17 differentiation cultures strongly inhibited the enhancement of Foxp3 by RA, but
could not abrogate the inhibitory effects of RA on IL-17 production (Figure 7C). Also, spleen
cells from RA-treated mice produced similar amounts of IL-6 upon treatment with antigen or
LPS (Figure 7D), suggesting that RA treatment did not decrease IL-6 production.
RA treatment inhibits EAE both during the induction and the effector phase of the disease
Although RA treatment in vivo under inflammatory conditions (i. e., immunization with CFA)
has only minor effects on the Foxp3+ Treg population, pathogenic Th17 and Th1 responses
nevertheless were strongly inhibited by RA. Therefore, based on the shift in the ratio of
MOG35-55-reactive effector and regulatory T cells, RA would inhibit development of EAE.
Indeed, when mice were immunized with MOG35-55/CFA to induce EAE, treatment with RA
from day 0 not only dramatically delayed the disease onset but also strongly decreased the
disease severity, compared to the control group (Figure 8 and Table I). Furthermore, when
administrated therapeutically after the onset of clinical signs of EAE, RA significantly
ameliorated the disease course (Figure 8 and Table I). These results confirm that RA treatment
in vivo not only inhibits proinflammatory Th17 and Th1 responses, but also has functional
consequences in that it dramatically suppresses the progression and severity of autoimmune
inflammation.

Discussion
RA, the physiological vitamin A metabolite, has recently been shown to enhance TGF-β-
induced Foxp3 expression and Treg conversion (23-26) and to decrease Th17 differentiation
and IL-17 production (26). In this study, we confirmed these results and determined the
mechanism by which RA increased Foxp3 expression but reciprocally decreased IL-17
production. Furthermore, we analyzed whether RA exerted similar effects in vivo during an
autoimmune reaction. We found that RA affected components in the TGF-β, IL-6/IL-21, and
TcR/CD3 signaling pathways that are involved in the development of Treg and Th17 cells.
Moreover, treatment with RA prevented autoimmune disease mainly by decreasing pathogenic
Th17 and Th1 responses, however, under this in vivo setting RA had no significant effect on
Treg cells possibly due to ongoing inflammation.
RA strongly increased TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression in vitro and thus enhanced Treg
conversion. Under these conditions, RA enhanced TGF-β signaling by increasing the
expression and phosphorylation of Smad3, which is one of the key elements responsible for
the induction Foxp3. RA exerts its regulatory effects by binding to its receptor RAR, which is
a transcription factor by itself. RA alone in the absence of TGF-β could increase the expression
of Smad3, however, the increased Smad3 phosphorylation and Foxp3 expression by RA is
completely dependent on TGF-β. On the other hand, it has been reported that the expression
of RAR can be increased by TGF-β signaling (33). Therefore, RA and TGF-β could
cooperatively augment their mutual signaling to further enhance Foxp3 expression. Moreover,
RA may also enhance Smad3-driven transactivation by promoting a direct RAR-Smad3
interaction since a direct RAR/Smad3 interaction has been demonstrated previously (34). RA
has also been reported to increase histone acetylation of the Foxp3 promoter regions (35). Since
histone acetylation is associated with increased gene activation and expression (36), this may
contribute to the RA-mediated increase in TGF-βinduced Foxp3 transcription.
In addition to the positive effect on TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression and Treg conversion,
RA also inhibited IL-6/IL-21-mediated Th17 differentiation. Inhibition of Th17 differentiation
by RA appears to be achieved by multiple mechanisms: 1) The enhanced TGF-β-induced Foxp3
expression by RA counteracts Th17 differentiation; 2) Inhibition of IL-6 receptor upregulation
by RA decreases Th17 differentiation; 3) RA downregulates IRF4 expression and thus impairs
IL-6-induced inhibition of Foxp3 expression and finally 4) RA inhibits IL-23R expression and
thus impairs the stabilization and further maturation of the Th17 phenotype. The inhibition of
IL-6 receptor expression not only decreases IL-6-initiated Th17 differentiation directly but also
counteracts the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on Foxp3 induction and results in increased Foxp3
levels that further inhibit the induction of IL-17. RA seems to have only minor effects on
proximal IL-6 or IL-21 signaling events. RA did not considerably affect either STAT3
phosphorylation or IL-21 expression induced by IL-6 or IL-21. However, RA reduced the
expression of IL-23R induced by either IL-6 or IL-21 alone or in combination with TGF-β.
This might be due to the fact that the RA/RAR complex binds to the promoter of the IL-23R
gene and transcriptionally represses IL-23R expression. Alternatively, RA binding to RAR
might exert a direct inhibitory effect on IL-6/IL-21 signaling downstream of STAT3 since the
expression of IL-23R is a downstream event of RORγt function and inhibition of RORγt
expression by RA has recently been reported (26,30). Both RAR and RORγt belong to a large
superfamily of ligand-inducible nuclear receptors that includes RXR and ROR, steroid, vitamin
D, and thyroid hormone receptors, estrogen receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (PPAR), and a number of orphan receptors whose ligands are unknown as yet (15).
Direct interactions among the family members (such as RAR/RXR heterodimers and RXR/
vitamin D3 receptor heterodimers) and between the transcription factors from other families
(such as vitamin D3 receptor/c-Jun and RAR/STAT3 interactions) have been reported (15,
37). Therefore, it is possible that RA interferes with the transactivation function of STAT3

and/or RORγt by inducing direct RAR/STAT3 and/or RAR/RORγt interactions and thus
inhibiting the IL-6/IL-21-induced expression of IL-23R, in addition to RA caused decrease of
RORγt expression. Conversely, it will be interesting to determine whether RAR also binds to
Foxp3, similar to NFAT (38), and enhances Foxp3 function.
Although downregulation of IL-23R by RA may not play a role for Th17 differentiation in our
in vitro APC-free systems, in which there is no source of IL-23 cytokine, IL-23/IL-23R
signaling is required for stabilizing the development and pathogenic function of Th17 cells in
vivo (10). Indeed, RA-treated MOG35-55-immunized mice have a decrease in the generation
of pathogenic Th17 responses, which is associated with a decreased expression of IL-23R. In
addition to its direct inhibition of pathogenic Th17 and Th1 responses, RA also exerts this
effect indirectly by decreasing the ability of APCs to generate Th1 and Th17 cells (data not
shown), although RA does not affect the production of IL-6 in these cells (Figure 7D). It has
previously been demonstrated that RA impairs the secretion of IL-12 from APCs and therefore
decreases Th1 differentiation (39,40). Whether RA-treated dendritic cells have an impaired
IL-23 production remains to be determined. Taken together, we propose that in vivo, the
inhibitory effects of RA on the generation of Th17 cells are due to direct inhibitory effects on
Th17 cells and modulation of APC function.
The decreased ratio of antigen-specific effector versus regulatory T cells upon treatment with
RA attenuates autoimmunity. Here, we provide evidence that this change in Teff/Treg ratio is
mainly due to a decrease of effector T cells in RA-treated mice. Unlike the in vitro observation
that RA strongly enhances Treg conversion, RA treatment in vivo only slightly increases the
population of Treg cells. Interestingly, Mucida et al also observed a remarkable reduction of
Th17 cells but not measurable enhancement of the differentiation of Foxp3+ Treg cells in mice
infected with Listeria monocytogenes and treated with RA, and they suggested that TGF-β
might be a limiting factor in the lack of Treg cell differentiation induced by exogenous RA in
vivo (26). Here we show that this minor expansion of Treg cells by RA in vivo appears to be
due to the strong induction of IL-6 as well as TNF-α and IL-1 during the inflammatory process
induced by MOG35-55/CFA immunization as addition of all these inflammatory cytokines into
Th17 differentiation cultures in vitro strongly inhibited the enhancement of Foxp3 by RA, but
could not abrogate the inhibitory effects of RA on Th17 cells (Figure 7C). This is also consistent
with our previous data showing that IL-6 inhibits the generation of iTreg cells and in MOG/
CFA immunized mice or under strongly inflammatory conditions, antigen specific Treg cells
are not generated de novo but are derived from nTreg cells (32).
The significant reduction of EAE by RA is associated with a decrease in Th17 and Th1
responses. However, the observation that IFN-g signaling may not be absolutely required for
the induction of EAE (2,3) suggests that the decreased Th17 response is most likely responsible
for the reduction of EAE by RA. Also, the decreased IL-23R expression by RA impairs IL-23
signaling which further dampens the encephalitogenicity of Th17 cells, since IL-23 signaling
has been shown to be crucial for full expression of the pathogenic phenotype in Th17 cells
(10). RA treatment after disease onset still attenuates the severity of EAE, suggesting that RA
also inhibits established disease by regulating not just the expansion but most likely the effector
functions of pathogenic Th17 and Th1 cells. Accordingly, we observed that addition of RA
into in vitro cultures of LN or spleen cells from mice with EAE also strongly inhibited CD4+
T cell proliferation and their production of IL-17 and IFN-g upon antigenic restimulation (data
not shown).
Although under inflammatory conditions in vivo, RA has minor effects on increasing the
frequency of Treg cells, it is likely that the blockade of TGF-β-induced upregulation of
IL-6Rα and the decrease of IRF4 expression by RA would reduce IL-6-mediated Treg

inhibition (41) and thus enhance their suppressive function, which may also play a role in the
strong inhibition of pathogenic Th1/Th17 responses in RA treated mice during EAE.
In summary, we demonstrated that RA both in vitro and in vivo inhibits the development of
Th17 cells by interfering with signaling events in the TGF-β and IL-6/IL-21/IL-23 pathways
that are involved in the development and function of these cells. Although RA strongly
promotes Treg conversion in vitro, RA treatment in vivo does not considerably increase the
population of Treg cells in the face of ongoing inflammation. However, in the absence of strong
inflammatory conditions, RA may be able to increase Treg cells in vivo as well. Therefore, RA
regulates the balance between pathogenic Th17 and protective Treg cells by enhancing TGF-
β signaling and by suppressing IL-6/IL-21/IL-23-driven signaling.
