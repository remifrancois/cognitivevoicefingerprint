Abstract
It is well established that voice is disordered in nearly 90% of
individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Given the role of voice in
language expression, we pose that optimizing vocal function may
lead to improved language production. Verb production is an area
of language deficit in PD, particularly for verbs associated with an
individual’s location of impairment (upper vs. lower limbs). It is
thought that damage to the motor system, given its connection to
action verbs, underlies this lexical effect. If this is the case, then
treatment improving vocal motor function may also improve access
to verbs. Nineteen participants with PD underwent Lee Silverman
Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®), a 4-week intensive voice
treatment (TXPD), in an IRB-approved randomized controlled voice
treatment trial. Language production was contrasted with 20
untreated PD (UNTXPD) and 20 age-matched neurotypical control
participants. Each provided 1-minute picture description narratives
at baseline and after 4-weeks. Pre-post treatment within- and
between-group comparisons identified effects of assessment time
point and isolated treatment effects in the TXPD relative to
UNTXPD and Controls. Given the intervention, the TXPD group
demonstrated a significant increase in loudness during the picture
description, as well as increased utterance length, diversity of word
types used, verbs per utterance, and lexical density.

Funding Statement


---

The LSVT LOUD treatment trial was funded by grant R01DC0115
from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders (Principal Investigator: Ramig).
Author Declarations
I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and
any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been
obtained.
Yes
The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or
exemption for the research described are given below:
data were collected at the National Center for Voice and Speech-
Denver, an affiliate of the University of Colorado-Boulder (UCB).
Additional screening/inclusion and demographic data were
collected from neurology and otolaryngology offices in Denver, and
the radiology department of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center-Denver (UCHSC). Study procedures were approved
by the institutional review board at the University of Colorado at
Boulder and are shared at ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00123084. All participants provided informed written consent
for participation.
I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been
obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been
archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers
included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or
participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be
used to identify individuals.
Yes
I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective
interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved
registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study
reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial
registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study
registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID

field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).
Yes
I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and
uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting
checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if
applicable.
