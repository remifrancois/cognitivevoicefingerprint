Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurological ailment affecting both mobility and cognitive
function, posing considerable problems to the health of the elderly across the world. The absence of a
conclusive treatment underscores the requirement to investigate cutting-edge diagnostic techniques
to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize PD detection by
applying large repositories of structured data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. 133 papers published
between 2021 and April 2024 were reviewed using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology,
and subsequently classiﬁed into ﬁve categories: acoustic data, biomarkers, medical imaging,
movement data, and multimodal datasets. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into
the applications of ML in PD diagnosis. Our SLR identiﬁes the datasets and ML algorithms used for PD
diagnosis, as well as their merits, limitations, and evaluation factors. We also discuss challenges,
future directions, and outstanding issues.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder caused by the
death or impairment of speciﬁc midbrain neurons, mainly categorized as a
“Movement Disorder”1. This condition is primarily caused by the degen-
eration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the
brain. This impairment causes a signiﬁcant reduction in dopamine levels,
which disrupts motor control and leads to symptoms such as tremors,
muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and difﬁculty walking2.
Dopamine is a chemical messenger that helps produce smooth and coordi-
nated muscle and movement functions by transferring signals between the
SN and another area of the brain called the corpus striatum3. Regarding
motor control, dopamine enhances communication between the SN and the
striatum, leading to the nigrostriatal pathway. This pathway regulates motor
circuit activity, allowing for the smooth initiation of voluntary motions.
Cognitive and behavioralproblems, including dementia and depression, may
develop as the disease progresses2.
Beyond motor symptoms, PD can also manifest with various non-
motorissues.Rigidity,speechdisorder,resttremors,constipation,instability
in gait, rapid eye movement (REM), postural instability, and bradykinesia
are examples of motor symptoms. In contrast, non-motor symptoms
include neurobehavioral, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, cognitive
decline, and sensory issues4. These symptoms are primarily due to a lack of
dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that regulates coordination and
motion. Understanding the signiﬁcance of dopamine insufﬁciency is critical
for creating successful therapies for PD. A vital treatment is dopamine
replacement therapy, which functions as a precursor todopamine and helps
reﬁll its generalizability might represent an ongoing, unresolved levels in the
brain, alleviating motor symptoms. However, a cure for the condition is still
not available5. Scientists are conducting research to improve patient care,
develop earlier diagnosis methods, and create more effective treatments for
the illness6,7.
Detecting the appropriate treatments to halt the progression of the
diseasecanbefacilitatedbytheearlydiagnosisofPD,ongoingmonitoringof
the condition’s severity (i.e., preserving the health of the brain’s neurons),
and monitoring the progress of those treatments over time. However,
diagnosing PD can be challenging due to its complexity and the need for
clinical expertise, which may result in misdiagnosis8. Therefore, novel, less
expensive, simpler, and more reliable approaches to Parkinson’s diagnosis
and treatment should be developed9,10. Researchers employed several
machine learning (ML) techniques to improve intelligent systems that can
accurately diagnose PD across various datasets. ML approaches are the
process of automatically applying algorithms to datasets to retrieve valuable
patterns. Typically, these approaches are used to train a computer-aided

diagnosissystemtomakedecisionsaboutclassifyingpreviouslyunidentiﬁed
datainstances.MLapproachesarecategorizedintosupervisedlearning(e.g.,
classiﬁcation and regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering), and
reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning)11. In the context of PD diagnosis,
ML approaches may assess patient data such as motor symptoms, imaging
scans, and genetic data to recognize patterns over time and estimate disease
progression7,12.
Furthermore, some researchers have used a group of ML methods
named deep learning (DL) to address the challenges of ML by auto-
mating feature extraction. DL uses multilayer ANN. DL excels at
extracting beneﬁcial features from diverse data such as neuroimaging
data, motor symptoms, and time series13,14. This feature is beneﬁcial
during PD diagnosis, where slight alterations in motor functions or brain
activity might be challenging to recognize manually. Popular DL models,
such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), demonstrated potential in processing multiple types
of patient data for PD diagnosis15–17. By comparing the efﬁcacy of several
ML and DL algorithms in diagnosing PD, we intend to emphasize their
potential to enhance early diagnosis, track disease progression, and
assess the treatment process.
Conducting a thoroughly systematic literature review (SLR)18,19 in
diagnosing PD based on ML with an emphasis on improvements,
research questions, future works, and PD detection directions is rare.
This paper not only reviews the application of well-known ML algo-
rithms in detecting Parkinson’s patients but also studies popular datasets
and approaches and compares their limitations and speciﬁcations.
Increasing usage of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in medicine and disease
detection has shaped the scheme of our research on diagnosing PD.
Finally, our research may assist in developing more precise and reliable
diagnostic methods for PD, improving patients’ quality of life as well as
health conditions. We have addressed the following research questions
to synthesize the relevant information and efﬁciently convey knowledge
to the research associations:
• What types of data sets are used to diagnose PD?
• Which category of data sets is used the most to diagnose PD?
• What tools are used the most in assessing ML approaches in
diagnosing PD?
• What evaluation metrics are commonly used to assess the ML tech-
niques in diagnosing PD?
• WhatMLalgorithmshavebeenconsideredthemostindiagnosingPD?
• What validation methods are used in studies diagnosing PD with ML?
• What are the major challenges, future trends, and open issues in
diagnosing PD with ML?
Our investigation highlights the growing interest and rapid expansion
of studies incorporating ML in diagnosing PD. The utilization of ML
technology within healthcare systems, particularly in the context of neu-
rodegenerative diseases such as PD, is becoming increasingly necessary as it
continues to improve. In particular, this literature review offers valuable
information for:
• Healthcare and ML researchers: We offer a thorough review of the
current state of ML approaches and methods for PD diagnosis, pro-
viding insights for those interested in further exploration in this ﬁeld.
• Neurologists and medical professionals: Understanding ML-based PD
diagnosis methods, strategies, and tools could prove helpful for the
diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

In another study, Tanveer et al.22 offered a review of papers from 2013
to 2021 that focused on using deep neural network (DNN) and ANN to
detect PD. The authors analyzed various data modalities and model per-
formances, ﬁnding that convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN)
models excelled in time-series accuracy. They also concluded that the per-
formance of ANNs improved when clinical features were incorporated.
Lastly, they outlined the pros and cons of these models and suggested topics
for future research. Further, Sigcha et al.23 assessed 69 papers on using ML
and DL to analyze motor and non-motor data from wearables. The selected
papers were from 2012 to 2022, focusing on monitoring and diagnosingPD.
Also, they provided some future trends and challenges.
Additionally, Skaramagkas et al.24 presented a systematic review
leveraging DL approaches to discriminate PD symptoms effectively with
motor symptoms. They investigated 87 papers from 2016 to 2023 over DL,
considering speech, upper limb, facial expression, and gait data. Moreover,
Amato et al.25 reviewed acoustic features and ML methods for detecting PD.
They analyzed 102 papers published from 2017 to 2022. Their focus was on
statistically evaluating the applied techniques and algorithms. Khanna
et al.26 investigated the application of neuroimaging and ML methodologies
inthediagnosisofdifferentdisorders,suchasPD,Alzheimer’sdisease(AD),
and Schizophrenia. The distinctive aspect of this study resided in its
incorporation of the most recently published scholarly publications.
Keserwani et al.27 examined various ML, meta-heuristic, and DL
models for diagnosing PD. Additionally, they improved the accuracy of
existing models by utilizing speech signal datasets. Furthermore, potential
future directions were explored. Also, Islam et al.28 analyzed ML and DL
methods for diagnosing PD, speciﬁcally looking at handwriting and wave
databases. They explored different algorithms and the nuances of bio-
markers to improve diagnosis. Findings suggested these techniques in
diagnosing patients, though the study also outlined certain constraints and
potential directions for future research. In another review, Sabherwal and
Kaur29 assessed the effectiveness of ML and DL algorithms regarding PD
detection.Variousmethodswereanalyzed.Also,theirlimitationsandfuture
trends were discussed. Papers were selected from 2013 to 2023 over the
mentioned area. Giannakopoulou et al.30 also reviewed ML algorithms
trained on data collected from wearable sensors and IoT devices for pre-
dicting PD. The authors surveyed 112 papers in an SLR manner, high-
lighting the best methods and tools. Moreover, some open issues and future
challenges were discussed.
Furthermore, Rana et al.31 offered a review to identify the common and
accessible AI algorithms and ML techniquesfor detectingPDpatients. They
reviewed 112 papers and examined them in terms of data and methods. The
study results indicated that ML and biomarker data had the highest efﬁ-
ciency in PD detection. They also discussed some future trends and chal-
lenges. Zhang32 categorized ML-based techniques of PD diagnosis into 3
groups by assessing 51 papers from 2006 to 2019, namely discrimination
between PD and healthy control (HC), differential diagnosis, and early PD
detection. Also, results demonstrate that the use case of ML improves the
accuracy of PD identiﬁcation. Moreover, some challenges and future solu-
tionswereintroduced.Also,Chandrabhatlaetal.33investigatedthecommon
ML models and computational techniques used for detecting PD from 1970
to 2020. This review was carried out by using the US National Library of
Medicine PubMed database, showing the signiﬁcant advances in the
mentioned area.
Table 2 shows that while the covered time by previous papers is broad,
theyevaluatedalimitednumberofstudies.TheworksofSalarietal.21,Sigcha
et al.23, Giannakopoulou et al.30, and Rana et al.31 cover fewer studies over
moreextendedperiod.Moreover,onlythreepapers(Ranaetal.31,Keserwani
et al.27, and Islam et al.28) offer classiﬁcations. Also, it should be noted that
several studies did not examine datasets at all, including those by Rana
et al.31, Sabherwal and Kaur29, Khachnaoui et al.20, Khanna et al.26, Gian-
nakopoulou et al.30, Zhang32, and Chandrabhatla et al.33. However, out of
thesestudies,theworkofSkaramagkasetal.24issimilartoourinvestigations.
In this SLR, 80 publications between 2016 and 2023 have been reviewed, but
itsauthorsdidnotpresentanytaxonomyorstudyappliedtools.Islametal.28
conducted another close effort; however, it introduced a taxonomy that
focused solely on handwriting and voice data, examining fewer experiments
than ours from 2000 to March 2023 and did not present the employed tools.
The closest in breadth, Rana et al.31, assessed a small number of studies, did
not evaluate datasets, and did not comprehensively address open issues. In
addition, it was not written in a systematic way.
Furthermore, the reviews by Amato et al.25, Chandrabhatla et al.33, and
Khachnaoui et al.20 did not discuss open issues, did not present any tax-
onomy or classiﬁcation, and were not written systematically. Given these
gaps, a comprehensive SLR is needed that not only addresses these limita-
tions but also clearly identiﬁes open issues and future research directions.
On the other hand, the statistical correctness of our work is enhanced by its
careful evaluation of 133 publications published between 2021 and April
2024.Themajorityofpriorevaluationswerenotstructuralandweremissing
some crucial pieces of information. They often failed to consider tools,
present any taxonomy or classiﬁcation, or discuss the merits, downsides,
and unanswered concerns. As of right now, a comprehensive evaluation of
the various datasets utilized for PD diagnosis with ML has not been
published.
Research methodology
Researchers have introduced various techniques for diagnosing PD. This
section describes the systematic phases of examining various ML approa-
ches for diagnosing PD. Figure 2 illustrates that, in contrast to the non-
structured review process, the SLR process reduces bias while identifying
research directions and open issues by following the correct phases in a
methodical sequence for investigating the literature19,34,35. SLR methods are

based on well-deﬁned instructions to identify, provide the desired results,
analyze,andanswerthedeﬁnedquestions.Therefore,thispaperutilizesSLR
guidelines to design a three-stage review procedure: planning, conducting,
and documenting18.
Planning
The planning phase originates by deﬁning the reason for the research and
culminates in establishing the methodology for the review protocol in the
following manner:
Stage 1: research motivation. An SLR is needed to classify and compare
published studies on diagnosing PD by utilizing a characterization fra-
mework. While the causes of PD are uncertain, medication and surgery
can relieve its symptoms. However, early diagnosis of the syndrome and
its progression rates may be crucial in determining suitable treatments.
Therefore, scientists have developed various techniques to address this
issue and improve PD’s diagnosis accuracy. This has raised the motiva-
tion to conduct a systematic review on the application of different ML
approaches for diagnosing PD, categorizing them taxonomically, and
presenting a concise comparative analysis of the applied datasets and
techniques, as well as their potential limitations and challenges.
According to our ﬁndings, few papers give an in-depth review of this
subject. Since the evaluations of previous studies had limitations, provided
no analysis on applied tools, and evaluated insufﬁcient datasets, presenting
anSLRisessential.Bycontrast,ourSLRcarefullyassesses133currentpapers
to offer a systematic categorization of datasets utilized in ML for PD diag-
nosis, addressing signiﬁcant gaps in prior research. This detailed assessment
helpstoimprovediagnosticmethods,achieveourfollowinggoals,andguide
future advancements in the ﬁeld.
• To include papers that have recently been published
• To outline any potential future works
• To investigate evaluation factors and applied tools
• To present a comprehensive taxonomy, concise statistical information,
and simulationtools and precisely deﬁne the paper selectionprocedure
Stage 2: research questions. We have developed research questions
based on our motivation to conduct an impartial and scientiﬁc exam-
ination of PD datasets and the ML algorithms utilized in detecting the
disease at its early stages. Answering the deﬁned questions identiﬁes
available issues on this topic, which could also assist in brainstorming
fresh ideas throughout this documentation phase. Table 3 highlights
these research questions (RQs):
Stage 3: review protocols. We have presented and implemented a
review protocol, which includes a set of questions, the paper selection
method, and data extraction in Stages 1, 2, and 3 of the conducting
phases. Following the guidelines in18 and36, we sought feedback from a
third-party expert with experience in conducting SLRs on ML and

healthcare systems to evaluate the protocol before its implementation.
We incorporated his recommendations to modify the protocol. In
addition, we conducted a pilot study (including about 20% of the papers)
to eliminate researcher bias and boost the extraction of data. We have
improved the inclusion/exclusion criteria, search strategies, and the
scope of the review during this stage. In addition, a protocol was designed
based on37 and our prior experience in conducting systematic reviews38–51.
Conducting
The conducting phase of the research process begins with choosing the
papers and ends with the extraction of data. This section attempts to clarify
the process of seeking and selecting articles throughout the second phase of
the SLR. This section consists of two parts. First, study selection explains the
process of selecting papers, and second, data extraction and synthesis,
expressing how we have accomplished the review.
Stage 1: study selection process. This section describes the process of
identifying and choosing articles during the second phase of SLR. As
demonstrated in Fig. 3, we choose papers in this timeframe employing a two-
stepprocedure.Oneofthemostcrucialrequirementsofdevelopingaresearch
plan is ﬁnding all publications without bias. Standard strings were found and
added to the search phrase to achieve this objective. A review methodology
was also designed to help identify relevant and unbiased research. During the
ﬁrst selection procedure, all search terms associated with Parkinson and ML
algorithms were chosen to ensure that no papers were missed. Throughout
this stage, the following search terms were employed in the abstracts, titles,
and keywords of six academic online databases:
• Initial selection: we conducted a thorough search throughout many
reputable databases, namely Elsevier, IEEE, Taylor & Francis, Springer,
ACM,Nature,andWiley,usingthesearchphrasesuppliedbelow,which
included keywords, titles, and abstracts. Our search, speciﬁcally utilizing
the journal citation reports (JCR) as a source, spans 2021 through April
2024. This timeframe was selected due to the signiﬁcant variety and
volume of publications in PD detection employing ML methods. 729
papers related to the collaborative ﬁeld of ML and PD detection were
found as a result of this search. These papers were published in various
sources, including journals, conferences, and book chapters.

• Final selection: the papers extracted in the previous step were exam-
ined, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 4) were applied. Sur-
vey papers, theses, non-English papers, books, non-peer-reviewed
papers, conference papers, short papers, and book chapters were
excluded. The selected papers were thoroughly read, and quality
assessment was used to include only those papers that presented
evaluating details and approaches. At the end of this stage, 133 relevant
studies were chosen for qualitative evaluation.
Stages 2 and 3: data extraction and synthesis. We acquired data from
a list of online academic databases. We provided it in a systematic format
based on characterization aspects employing the guidelines above. A
structured analysis was created by exploring the restrictions and poten-
tials of the studied papers, as well as the perspectives on future studies,
providing us with an exploration of the collective study ﬁndings. We
extracted data from the examined papers, concentrating on dataset types,
applied tools/algorithms, advantages, disadvantages, paper main ideas,

Documenting
In the documenting phase (see Fig. 2), observations are recorded, and the
discussion of threats to validity and limitations is provided in Section
“Threats to validity and limitations”. The results are evaluated, visualized,
and presented in Section “Analysis of results”.
Classiﬁcation of the selected studies
Thispaperpresentsaclassiﬁcationdesignedtoachievetwomajorobjectives.
First, it facilitates an SLR of the extensive body of research on PD diagnosis
using ML approaches. Second, organizing the studies into ﬁve data-driven
categories—illustrated in Fig. 4—enhances readers’ understanding of the
main research areas in the ﬁeld. The proposed classiﬁcation highlights the
important role of datasets in diagnostic results. For instance, the adoption of
multimodal datasets demonstrates growing interest in innovative approa-
ches that leverage diverse data sources to improve the accuracy of PD
diagnosis. Although alternative classiﬁcation exists, our classiﬁcation, to the
best of our knowledge, has not been adopted in earlier reviews. By con-
centratingondatasets,thisworkoffersauniqueperspectivethatemphasizes
boththepivotalroleofdatainMLperformanceandtheexistinggapsindata
diversity and availability.
This section also investigates 133 papers to determine the PD dataset,
diagnosis approaches, objectives, and applied approaches. In addition, we
provide the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches by using
assessment metrics deﬁned in Table 5. Moreover, Fig. 4 illustrates the
proposed classiﬁcation forPD;while presentinga classiﬁcationfor PD is not
a trivial task, it allows readers to easily access dataset resources and the
related papers, providing a holistic understanding of the ﬁeld and helping to
identify research gaps. However, each researcher may adopt a different
approach to categorization due to their unique perspective.
Furthermore,theselectedpaperappliesMLapproachestospeedupthe
diagnosis of PD using proper datasets. These datasets are classiﬁed into ﬁve
groups: acoustic data/features, medical imaging, movement data, bio-
markers, and multimodal datasets.
Figure 4 presents the categorization used in this review, which is based
on the datasets utilized for diagnosing PD. Five major categories were
identiﬁed, each reﬂecting the unique characteristics and data extraction
methods of their respective datasets.
Acoustic data/features
Acoustic data is crucial for diagnosing PD, as audio symptoms can be
detectedearly,oftenbeforenoticeablemotorsymptomsappear52.Therefore,
diagnosing PD through this information can signiﬁcantly enhance the
quality of life for the affected individuals2. Symptoms of PD can be classiﬁed
into two categories: dysphonia and dysarthria53. In the early stages of
diagnosis, the identiﬁcation of dysphonic indicators candelay the severityof
the disease. Furthermore, recording voices is a relatively low-cost approach,
and physical examination can be time-consuming54. Therefore, having
sufﬁcient data for training ML models could signiﬁcantly expedite PD
prediction and improve patient well-being. In Table 6, we present data from
databasesrelated toacoustic-based papers,includingthe number of patients
and healthy subjects, the gender of patients, and details such as extracted
features,audioﬁleformat,and thenumberofsamples.Table7comparesthe
reviewed studies, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, main ideas,
applied tools, and algorithms. The evaluation parameters employed in
acoustic-based papers are analyzed in Table 8. In Section “Review of
acoustic-based approaches”, acoustic-based approaches are reviewed.
Ultimately, Section “Qualitative analysis of acoustic-based approaches”
presentsaqualitativeanalysisofacoustic-basedapproaches,examiningtheir
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Review of acoustic-based approaches. Yao et al.55 proposed a model
based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) along with an IP-
based whale optimization algorithm (WOA). This study aimed to diag-
nose pathological speech in PD and cleft lip and palate patients.
According to the results, the proposed model provided high precision
and accuracy. Also, Khaskhoussy and Ayed56 proposed a method to
detect PD by analyzing speech data, and they also used SVM and con-
volutional neural network (CNN) to classify speech data. The results
showed that this method has high accuracy and speciﬁcity. Meanwhile,
Celik et al.57 developed the SkipConNet + RF diagnostic model for PD
detection via speech signals. The model integrated CNN and RF algo-
rithms. SkipConNet extracted vital speech signal features, and the RF
predicted these features. According to the study, the presented model
surpassed other DL and ML methods in accuracy.
Following a similar investigative ﬁeld, Ali et al.58 introduced an
ensemble method named ensemble model with optimal features and
sample-dependent base classiﬁers (EOFSC) for identifying individuals with
PD. The technique addressed issues of generalization and low accuracy by
analyzing voices. Also, Masud et al.59 developed the crow search and deep
learning (CROWD) model for diagnosing and classifying PD. The model
employed the adaptive crow search algorithm (ACSA) to select the com-
pressed feature vector and a DL-based autoencoder to generate the com-
pressed feature vector. The outcomes also indicated that the proposed
model achieved high sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy. Yücelbaş60
introduceda model to diagnose PD in the early stages using acoustic signals.
Based on the results, the information gain algorithm-based k-nearest
neighbors (IGKNN) model had high accuracy and recall.
Regarding the detection of PD with ML approaches in a quicker
manner, Wang et al.61 introduced a system for diagnosing PD using speech
data and DL methods. Also, results showed that the mentioned system was
highly accurate. Moreover, Dhar54 designed a two-phase reduction system
with the objective of diagnosing PD in its early stages. The ﬁrst reduction
steps comprised ML-based feature selection, whereas the other phase
employed unsupervised techniques. High performance, as indicated by
accuracy and AUC, was demonstrated through the comparisons and
assessment ﬁndings. Li et al.62 introduced a method called two-step transfer
learning (TSTL) to identify Parkinson’s patients from healthy individuals
based on speech patterns. Also, their method was evaluated with a new and
publicly available dataset. In addition, the results showed that the presented
method had high accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity.
Moreover, Vital et al.63 presented a model based on neural networks to
detect individuals with PD by analyzing their voices. They compared the
method with various ML algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), random
forest (RF(, and AdaBoost. Based on the results, the accuracy and efﬁciency
of the model were conﬁrmed. In a related study, Jyotiyana et al.64 presented
an approach for PD diagnosis using DL techniques. In this study, audio data

were used to evaluate the proposed approach, and high accuracy was
achieved. Masood et al.65 developed a two-level ensemble-based character-
isticselectionmodelaimedatearlydetectionofPDusingvoicedataanalysis.
Inaddition,thismodelwashighlyaccurate.Similarly,Garcíaetal.66offereda
high-accuracy two-level ensemble-based attribute selection model aimed at
early detection of PDusing voicedata analysis.In a similarvein,Hireš et al.67
suggested a method based on a CNN ensemble for diagnosing PD using
voice data. Additionally, the results showed that this method provides high
ROC (AUC), speciﬁcity, and accuracy.
Ma et al.68 presented a deep dual-sidelearningensemble modelbased on
the deep sample learning (DSL) algorithm, combined with deep feature
learning, for recognizing PD via speech. An embedded deep-stacked group
sparse autoencoder (EGSAE) extracted high-quality deep features. The
resultsdemonstratedthemethod’shighaccuracy.Nevertheless,thisapproach
required further validation and rebuilding of deep samples using a deeper
neural network. Quan et al.69 developed a model to diagnose PD via speech
signals and an end-to-end learning architecture. The proposed method
employed a combination of time-distributed two-dimensional CNN (2D-
CNN) and a one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) to extract dynamic features
from speech signal time series and remove interdependence. Moreover, the
method demonstrated high accuracy based on the obtained results.
In a similar vein, Chen et al.70 suggested an IP-based chimpanzee
optimization algorithm (IPChOA) to enhance DCNN. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of this method was assessed using speech signals from both PD
and cleft lip and palate cases. The results showed that this method reached a
high level of accuracy. Meanwhile, Khaskhoussy and Ayed71 presented an
approach for diagnosing PD using ML techniques and speech processing,
while also identifying early changes associated with the condition. They also
used features like the mel-frequency brain coefﬁcients-gaussian mixture
model (MFCC-GMM). This study demonstrated high accuracy. In addi-
tion, Biswas et al.72 introduced an approach for early diagnosis of PD using
an ensemble-based ML model called the ensembled expert system for
diagnosis of PD (EESDPD). The suggested method had high accuracy,
recall, and F1-score.
Wei Liu et al.73 developed a model based on speech features and an
ANN to diagnose PD. The results showed that the proposed model has high
accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC. Also, Yuan et al.74 investigated the detection
of PD utilizing speech signals and ML approaches. Using the ReLU acti-
vation function, the authors developed a DNN architecture with multiple
concealed layers. In addition, the minimum redundancy-maximum cor-
relation (mRMR) method was used to identify key features. The outcomes
showed that the suggested method obtained a high F1-score, accuracy, and
MCC. Moreover, Kamalakannan et al.75 evaluated different classiﬁcation
methods for diagnosing PD. J48, SVM, and multilayer perceptron neural
network (MPNN) methods achieved the highest accuracy.
Salehetal.76presentedamethodforidentifyingPDbasedonaudiodata
as well as ML and ANN approaches. Additionally, this method achieved a
high level of accuracy. Also, Devarajan et al.77 examined the application of
ML methods to enhance the qualityof diagnoses in the healthcare ﬁeld, with
a speciﬁc focus on PD. In addition, they have devised ML ensembles to
identify PD, emphasizing the utilization of nonclinical patient data for early
detection.
Guatelli et al.78 offered a technique for diagnosing PD based on neural
networks utilizing the extreme learning machine (ELM) and acoustic signal
spectrograms. The results demonstrated the practical application potential
of this method, particularly considering the lower cost and shorter time
required for training compared to traditional CNN-based methods. Addi-
tionally, the suggested method had a high level of accuracy. Also, Hireš
et al.79 measured the efﬁciency of two varied ML models, namely CNN and
XGboost, to detect computerized PD. The Authors evaluated their model
regarding accuracy, speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and AUC via four datasets. The
result revealed that even if the result in a database is acceptable, it could not
be the same as others.
Pah et al.53 evaluated the efﬁcacy of ML approaches in PD identiﬁca-
tion. They also investigated other voice disorders, such as laryngitis and
dysphonia. Moreover, Eguchi et al.80 proposed a methodology that
employedatransformermodeltodistinguishbetweenpatientsafﬂictedwith
PD and those with spinal cerebellar degeneration using speech data. Also,
accuracy and AUC metrics for the proposed model were comparatively
high. In addition, Dhanalakshmi et al.2 provided a technique that uses
speech features and ML techniques to detect early-stage PD. In addition,
they focused on optimizing classiﬁcation performance and addressing

the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, which are
discussed in detail below:
• Strengths: Our analysis of acoustic-based approaches reveals three
considerable advantages. Firstly, it is low-cost. Secondly, it is non-
invasive, so it does not provide any thread for the patients. Lastly, the
solution they provide is scalable and can be utilized in real-world
settings. Moreover, the very ﬁrst important feature is that vocal
symptoms may appear years before other symptoms, and as a result, it
makes early detection possible. The accessibility is outstanding since it
can be used as a mobile application, making it widely available and
suitable for real-world usage.
• Weaknesses: On the other hand, it needs to be mentioned that the
diagnosis models may not work effectively in noisy environments,
leading to misdiagnosis. The lack of diverse language and culturally
rich datasets may produce bias in results. On top of this, models in this
approach did not suggest a combination of vocal data with other forms
of data, such as movement and medical imaging.
• Opportunities: Addressing these weaknesses can improve model
reliability. Employing noise reduction and advanced techniques in
speech analysis is essential. Moreover, using diverse databases that
reﬂect a variety of ethnicities and languages may improve the model’s
capabilities. The combination of acoustic data and other forms of data,
widely utilized to detect PD, may lead to a better resolution.
• Threats: Several vital concerns should be addressed in future work. As
the volume of data increases, maintaining standardization becomes
more challenging, which may directly impact the real-world applic-
ability of the models. Additionally, reliance solely on acoustic data
could lead to misclassiﬁcation.
Medical imaging
Neurological disorders directly affect the brain; therefore, a visual brain
image can be suitable for detecting a disease82. PET and SPECT are two
approaches that can detect PD; however, they are less commonly utilized
due to their cost and invasiveness83. Nevertheless, alternative methods, such
as dopamine transporters (DAT) scanned applying 123I-ioﬂupane and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be employed alongside ML for
detecting PD84. Table 9 presents the databases utilized in medical imaging,
includingsuchdetailsasthenameofthedatasource,typeofimages,number
of samples, and additional information like the participants’ age and data
format. Table 10 compares the papers based on their main ideas, employed
tools, and algorithms, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.
Additionally, Table 11 provides the critical parameters used in the evalua-
tion process. Section “Review of medical imaging-based approaches”
reviewsmedicalimaging-basedapproaches.Intheend,aqualitativeanalysis
of approaches, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats,
is performed in Section “Qualitative analysis of medical imaging-based
approaches”.
Review of medical imaging-based approaches. Zhao et al.85 pre-
sented a CNN-based method utilizing diffusion tensor imaging to assess
the diagnostic performance of a hybrid architecture for detecting PD
across multiple brain regions. The study also employed a greedy algo-
rithm to combine various areas for ﬁnal prediction. The proposed
method demonstrated a high AUC according to the results. Likewise,
Shibata et al.86 suggested a model to identify moderate cognitive
impairment (MCI) in PD patients using quantitative susceptibility
mapping (QSM) images. The study utilized ML algorithms, including
light GB, extreme GB, and RF. The results indicated that RF achieved a
satisfactory level of performance and accuracy.
Gaurav et al.87 introduced a CNN-based framework for automatically
assessing and segmenting neuromelanin in the SN of early-stage Parkin-
son’s patients. According to the results, the proposed framework achieved
high accuracy and repeatability. Furthermore, the method could process
large datasets in a signiﬁcantly shorter time. Also, Nakano et al.88 investi-
gated the effects of motor and non-motor symptoms on health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) and identiﬁed brain networks associated with using
MRI in Parkinson’s patients. Next, Dünnwald et al.89 suggested a CNN
model for automating the extraction of biomarker data from multi-rater
segmentation and multi-scale localization to detect individuals with PD.

the DSC and Euclidean distance.
Adams et al.90 presented a technique to predict the motor performance
of individuals with PD. They employed CNN to interpret data from a
combination of DAT SPECT imaging and clinical measures, including
motor segment assessment. The results demonstrated that this DL-based
combination improved the prediction of movement performance in Par-
kinson’s patients. Also, Shin et al.91 presented an algorithm that employs a
DL-based CNN to interpret nigrosome 1 susceptibility map-weighted
imaging(SMwI) to assessnigrostriataldegeneration in idiopathic PD(IPD).
The results demonstrated that their proposed method provides rapid and

precise results for IPD diagnosis. Similarly, Xu et al.92 presented a technique
using a topological ML approach and resting-state functional MRI (rs-
fMRI) data to develop a biomarker for early PD detection and treatment
evaluation. Based on the ﬁndings, the suggested method reached a high
degree of accuracy.
Noella and Priyadarshini93 introduced a DCNN-based model to
identify PD and AD using ﬂuorodeoxyglucose PET brain scans. The results
showed that the model had high speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and accuracy. Fur-
thermore, Camacho et al.94 developed an explainable model to identify
Parkinson’s patients based on DL methods utilizing T1-weighted MRI data.
The results of the presented model showed high precision and accuracy. In
the same vein, Vyas et al.95 introduced two distinct neural networkmodels, a
2D CNN and a 3D CNN, to detect PD using MRI scans. In addition, both
models demonstrated acceptable effectiveness and performance.
Yasaka et al.96 proposed a CNN model to assess the potential of
detecting PD individuals using parameter weighting and the number of
streamlines. Results showed moderate performance in terms of AUC.
However, the external validation of the presented model’s performance had
not been conducted. Additionally, Dotinga et al.97 developed an SVM-based
model to distinguish PD patients from healthy people using I-123 FP-CIT
images. This model showed high accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity.
Piccardo et al.98 used a 3D CNN-based method combined with the
analysis of brain [18 F] DOPA PET/CT scans to diagnose PD. This method
showed acceptable accuracy and robustness. Moreover, Sun et al99. intro-
duced a radiomic DL model. This study used [18 F] FDG PET imaging to
diagnose PD, and the presented model showed signiﬁcant accuracy.
Nakajima et al.84 proposed an ML approach to detect dementia and PD
based on 123I-ioﬂupane images. According to the results, the proposed
approach had a high AUC (ROC).
Huang et al.100 proposed a method for improving the diagnosis of PD
through emotional facial expressions and DL techniques. The presented
model was evaluated using four datasets and achieved high accuracy. Also,

through handwriting analysis. Features gathered from the model were
optimized using a GA. The evaluations showed high accuracy and effec-
tiveness of the framework. In the same light, Pang et al.102 employed ML to

assess a model utilizing multi-level indicators of resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) for detecting different motor sub-
typesofPDpatients.Theﬁndingsshowedthattheproposedmodelachieved
a notable AUC value.
Balnarsaiah et al.103 demonstrated a method for diagnosing PD based
on DL approaches applied to MRI data. The Residual network (ResNeXt)
architecturewasutilizedinthisstudytoclassifybrainMRIimagestoidentify
Parkinson’s patients. As a result, the suggested method demonstrated sig-
niﬁcant accuracy in this research. Also, Xinchun Cui et al.104 presented a
method for classifying PD using MRI T2 slices. By combining DL with a
multi-branch feature processing module and multi-scale attention gui-
dance, the authors created a method to extract features to enhance classi-
ﬁcation performance. Based on the outcomes, the proposed method
obtained a high percentage of sensitivity, F1-score, accuracy, and speciﬁcity,
demonstrating its diagnostic efﬁcacy.
Wanget al.105 offeredan approachbasedon DL to detect PDwith QSM
and T1-weighted information automatically. The approach compromised
CNN and squeeze and excitation (SE)-ResNeXt50 models that analyze
image data. Evaluation results demonstrated the mentioned model’s per-
formance in terms of AUC. Also, Keles et al.106 offered a DNN model for
identifying PD patients by the SPECT images. They used 1231 images to
validate their models. Outcomes showed the quality of the model con-
cerning speciﬁcity, precision, accuracy, F1-score, and sensitivity. Besides,
Khachnaoui et al.107 presented a computer-aided system to diagnose PD via
pre-trained CNN models, bilinear pooling, and TL. These models were
trained by ImageNet. The results showed the model’s performance in terms
of accuracy.
Zhang et al.108 presented a method for predicting PD using graph
neural networks (GNNs) applied to MRI data. This study addressed two
main issues: the efﬁciency of constructing graphs from MRI data and the
overﬁttingofsmalldata.Also,Dingetal.83developedamodiﬁedtranscranial
sonography (TCS) technique employing the DCNN model to predict PD.
Further,this modeldemonstrated higher accuracy,sensitivity, PPV, and F1-
score. Moreover, Veetil et al.109 proposed a method using CNN models and
T1-weighted MRI data to diagnose PD. In addition, simulations were used
to investigate the problem of data leakage and high accuracy was also
achieved. Tran et al.110 developed DL models for diagnosing PD based on
retinal fundus images. Also, they achieved acceptable NPV and sensitivity.

attained. Secondly, it has become clear that CNN is one of the most
successful methods for PD diagnosis.
• Weaknesses: However, this approach has three major points: it is too
expensive due to the need for expertise and clinical tests such as MRI,
the techniques employed in this approach are primarily invasive, and it
needs high computational resources.
• Opportunities: Resolving these conﬂicts may increase the reliability of
medical-imaging-based approaches. Examining less invasive or non-
invasive techniques, making the applications broader. Also, more cost-
effective approaches, such as fMRI and DAT scans, can enhance
accessibility. Another way could be to combine imaging with genetics
orotherdatatoincreasetheaccuracyofdiagnosis.Also,usingMLasan
interpreter for data instead of data analysts may reduce the costs.
• Threats: Nevertheless, bias may rise if we do not consider diversity in
gathering imaging data, so researchers should consider global
populations in their test samples. Another challenge is logistical and
ethical in gathering such information, which also needs to be
addressed.
Movement data
Movement datasets are divided into three categories: gait, tremor, and
movement111. Such information is mainly utilized to determine the severity
of the condition. First, monitoring gait data is signiﬁcantly invaluable
because it can be gathered through wearable devices, which are primarily
low-cost112. Also, continuous data can help to ﬁnd appropriate therapy for
the patient and examine its effectiveness. However, it cannot be a good
approach for diagnosing the disease. Second, tremors are uncontrollable
body shaking and are mainly misdiagnosed; suitable data by using ML can
reducediagnosticerrors113.Themovementdatasetsutilizedintheexamined
papers are detailed in Table 12, which includes the names and references of
the sources, the categories of movement data, descriptions of the features,
and information regarding the age and gender of the participants. We

tabulate the main ideas, applied algorithms, tools, advantages, and dis-
advantages in Table 13. Table 14 also includes assessment parameters for
the reviewed studies, such as accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and F1-score.
In Section “Review of movement data-based approaches”, movement data-
based approaches are reviewed. Additionally, Section “Qualitative analysis
of movement data-based approaches” presents a qualitative analysis of
movement data-based approaches, including their strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats.
Review of movement data-based approaches. Vidya and P8 offered a
method aimed at detecting and classifying the severity of PD. The pro-
posed approach uses a multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM)
along with gait data analysis. This method showed high accuracy and
sensitivity. Plus, Nilashi et al.4 suggested a method that combined the
deep belief network (DBN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) to improve the accuracy of forecasting the uniﬁed PD rating
scale (UPDRS) and diagnosing PD. Additionally, the results demon-
strated a signiﬁcant reduction in time complexity while enhancing pre-
diction accuracy in the proposed approach, thereby supporting the early
diagnosis of PD through precise and efﬁcient UPDRS prediction. Also,
Hua Sun et al.114 presented an approach for forecasting FOG in PD by
integrating deep features acquired via the ResNeXt network with
manually selected gait features. The results demonstrated that the
approach exhibited high speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and accuracy.
Ullrich et al.115 developed an algorithmic approach utilizing inertial
measurement units (IMU) to evaluate and diagnose Parkinson’s patients’
gait tests. This study aimed to reduce patient interaction with the recording
system and reduce the amount of manual data annotation performed by
researchers. In addition, this algorithm achieved a high F1-score, recall, and
precision. Additionally, Rezaee et al.116 proposed an ML-based approach,
incorporatingdeeptransferlearning(DTL)usingelectromyographicsignals
for PD diagnosis. Moreover, the presented method achieved high accuracy
and sensitivity.
Zhao et al.117 introduced a method to detect the severity level of PD
through gait data and the ensemble K-nearest neighbor (EnKNN) algo-
rithm. The suggested method effectively handles the imbalanced data
distribution from Parkinson’s patients. Additionally, the proposed EnKNN
exhibited favorable performance and accuracy compared to other methods,
as demonstrated by the results. Besides, Borzì et al.118 used a multi-headed
CNN for detecting freezing of gait (FOG) in PD. The method utilized
inertial sensor data. Plus, this study fastened processing times, minimized
memory usage, and high accuracy. Likewise, Shcherbak et al.119 introduced
an approach for diagnosing early-stage PD (phases 1 and 2) using wearable
sensors, movement data, and ML. Overall, distinguishing between healthy
individuals and stage 2 patients resulted in improved outcomes, including
higher F1-micro scores and precision.
Pedrero-Sánchez et al.120 suggested a multi-branch CNN-based
method to classify PD and Alzheimer’s patients from healthy subjects using
functional mobility test data. The results showed that the proposed method
provided higher accuracy than parameter-based methods. Moreover,
Kovalenko et al.113 presented an approach to detect PD in essential tremors
utilizing ML techniques by analyzing video data. Further, this approach
obtained a high F1-score.
Gazda et al.121 presented a model that diagnosed PD by evaluating
people’s handwriting using CNN. Experimental results conﬁrmed the
high accuracy of the mentioned model. However, the authors did not
investigate their approach with larger datasets or employ any other net-
work architecture. Similarly, Ibrahim et al.122 offered a neural network
model capable of predicting PD motions across multiple stages and
minimizing delay using tremor data. Based on the evaluation results, the
model was highly accurate. Similarly, Kaur et al.123 utilized the data on
walking patterns to classify Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis patients.
Additionally, they evaluated different DL and ML methods, while CNN
showed higher accuracy.
Lin et al.124 proposed a neural network-based method that utilizes
movementdatafortheearlydetectionofPDand classiﬁcationofitsseverity.
This model demonstrated high accuracy. Also, Exley et al.125 presented a
method for measuring PD symptoms using ML and quiet standing data. In
this method, the AUC (ROC) was high. Furthermore, Li et al.126 presented a
DL-based framework to identify PD in rats with brain abnormalities. The
authors collected 3D movement data and employed DL for classiﬁcation.
The evaluated results indicated the high accuracy of the model.

Cesarelli et al.127 investigated the predictive capability of upper limb
features using ML algorithms to differentiate between normal people and
those with PD. This study achieved high accuracy. Besides, Alissa et al.128
presented a CNN-based system for detecting PD based on drawing data. As
a result of the proposed method, high accuracy was demonstrated. Addi-
tionally, Wang et al.129 developed an ML-based hybrid signal-processing
approach for the detection and severity estimation of PD. Five different ML
methods were evaluated in this study. The accuracy evaluation results
showed the high performance of the SVM model.
Maetal.130providedaninterpretablearchitectureusingDLmodelsand
stepping-shoepressuresensorsfortheearlydetectionofPD.Resultsshowed
that the proposed architecture achieved high identiﬁcation rates and
accuracy. Additionally, Ferreira et al.131 developed an approach aimed at
improving PD diagnosis and stage identiﬁcation. This study evaluated ﬁve
ML methods and analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics of gait. The
presented approach showed acceptable accuracy and AUC (ROC).
Valla et al.132 extracted tremor-related features from the archimedean
spiral drawing test to improve PD diagnosis through ML methods. The
authors employed ﬁlter methods like Fisher’s score and wrapper methods
like RFE for relevant feature selection. The method demonstrated high
accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity in the results. Furthermore, Tavares
et al.133 introduced an unsupervised algorithmic pipeline called uTUG,
which employed IMUs for motor assessment and PD diagnosis. Their
method signiﬁcantly enhanced precision, sensitivity, and F1-score in
detecting timed up-and-go (TUG) assessments using ML algorithms.
Soumen Roy et al.134 introduced an ML model that utilized keystroke
dynamics (KD) features duringtext typingona conventional keyboard.The
model employed a bootstrap-based homogeneous ensemble classiﬁcation
architecturealongwith ML techniquestodetectPDinitsDe-novo and early
stages. Among the ML methods examined, XGBOOST exhibited superior
performance. Moreover, the proposed model exhibited notable sensitivity
and speciﬁcity. Also, Huan Zhao et al.135 proposed a method to diagnose PD
byanalyzingdistinctgaitpatterncharacteristics.Theyidentiﬁedfeatureslike
asymmetry index, mean,and coefﬁcient variance fromParkinson’spatients’
gait patterns. Also, ensemble DT made an improvement in the diagnostic
process and accuracy. In the same light, Mirelman et al.136 introduced a
method that uses the data from wearable sensors and natural language
approaches to identifythe gait and mobilitycriteria of differentstagesofPD.
This study aimed to specify optimal sensor locations for each disease stage,
and the results showed high sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and AUC for the pro-
posed method.
Kumar et al.137 presented this study to identify the handwriting
dataset’s most effective task and establish a reliable diagnosis method.
The authors employed two variants of RNN, a DL technique based on
bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and LSTM. In
addition, the kinematic properties obtained through various ML
approaches were examined. The proposed procedure was highly
accurate, based on the outcomes. Besides, Zhao et al.138 introduced a
neural network approach to detect PD by classifying individuals’
handwriting. The comparison results reveal that the presented model
performs better than its counterparts. Nevertheless, the size of the data
could be expanded to improve.
Talitckii et al.139 presented a method for identifying the most effective
exercises for diagnosing PD using ML approaches and wearable sensors.
Three of the 15 common exercises with the highest discrimination power
achieved a high AUC (ROC) score. In addition, this method could improve
PD diagnosis, reduce hospitalization costs, and reduce the time required for
diagnosis. Moreover, Chen et al.140 implemented an optimizable model
using CNN architecture to detect PD accurately from daily walking and
adaptaccordingtothemostindicativespatiotemporalmotorcharacteristics.
The data was gathered from 100 subjects while walking 10 meters, mon-
itored by ﬁve sensors attached to their bodies. Moreover, the results indi-
cated high accuracy and AUC for the model.
Sotirakis et al.112 offered an approach to monitor the progression of
motor symptoms in Parkinson’s patients using ML methods. Also, the data
used wasgathered fromwearablesensors. Thisstudyobtained an acceptable
RMSE. Besides, Varghese et al.141 investigated different ML methods in
order to diagnose PD and differential diagnosis. Furthermore, they pre-
sented a movement dataset from wearable technologies to help develop
accurate diagnostic tools. This study achieved acceptable accuracy. Also,
Yang et al.142 introduced a method based on multi-level ensemble learning
using keystroke dynamics for PD diagnosis. The presented method showed
high accuracy. Cuk et al.143 offered an approach for early detection of PD
using LSTM neural networks and gait data. The results showed that this
approach was highly accurate.
Qualitative analysis of movement data-based approaches. In this
section, we critically analyzed the selected paper on movement-based
approaches. Also, the classiﬁcation of strengths, weaknesses, opportu-
nities, and threats has been detailed:
• Strengths: The qualitative assessment of the selected papers in
movement-based approaches led us to conclude that continuous
patient monitoring aids in real-time assessment of PD and directly
captures hallmark symptoms. The key advantage of movement-based
approaches is online data gathering, which is done by applying
wearable sensors.
• Weaknesses: On the contrary, although highly accurate sensors may
improve understanding of PD, they are expensive and may not be
available to everyone. Capturing data in controlled environments may
increase bias and cause other symptoms to be overlooked.
• Opportunities: One of the key areas researchers should focus on is
developing more affordable and high-tech wearable sensors to ensure
their availability for everyone. Moreover, combining these data with
vocal and biomarker data will help to get reliable and more accurate
results. These real-time datasets should also be used extensively for PD
progression monitoring and patient management.
• Threats: However, there are concerns about the privacy of continually
gathering PD patients and data sharing. Also, low-quality sensors
directly impact the mode performance, and the result may be
undermined.
Biomarkers
Parkinson’s latest reports suggest that the combination of genetic and
abnormal brain activity can contribute to the development of the disease6.
The analysis of genes and identiﬁcation of key genetic and brain malfunc-
tions accelerates PD detection, facilitating early diagnosis in potential
patients144. Thisapproach mayenable the developmentof targetedtherapies
that address the speciﬁc genetic and brain-related factors associated with
PD. Table 15 provides a summary of the biomarker datasets utilized in the
reviewed articles, detailing the types of biomarkers, extracted features,
demographicinformation,analyticalmethods,andsamplingtypes.Table16
presents the main ideas of the papers, applied algorithms, tools, advantages,
and disadvantages. Additionally, Table 17 compares several evaluation
metrics, such as accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity.
Section “Review of biomarker-based approaches” reviews biomarker-
based approaches. In the end, a qualitative analysis of approaches, including
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, is performed in Section
“Qualitative analysis of biomarker-based approaches”.
Review of biomarker-based approaches. Arora et al.1 compared dif-
ferent ML techniques to detect PD through amino acid composition and
hydrophobicity. In the proposed approach, the recall and F1-score were
high. Likewise, Xie et al.6 proposed a model that combined ML techni-
ques, such as RF models and ANN, to diagnose PD. They also investi-
gated the role of immune cell inﬁltration in PD. Moreover, Göker et al.145
developed a DL-based method for detecting PD in its early stages using
EEG signals. In order to create the automatic model, welch spectral
analysis was combined with BLSTM. Also, based on the outcomes, this
method attained high scores for the evaluation criteria like precision,
speciﬁcity, MCC, accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-score.

Lal et al.146 developed and evaluated an architectural pipeline for PD
diagnosis using resting-state EEG. This paper suggested utilizing ML models
with a focus on the KNN classiﬁer. In addition, their method achieved high
accuracy. Also, Soojin Lee et al.147 presented a model based on a CRNN
composedof RNN,CNN,andgated recurrentunits(GRUs)utilizingresting-
stateEEG.Additionally,CRNNdisplayedhighrecall,precision,andaccuracy.
Chang et al.148 developed an attention-based sparse graph convolutional
neural network (ASGCNN) approach for early PD detection using electro-
encephalography (EEG) signals. This study uncovered statistically signiﬁcant
disparities between patients with PD and healthy individuals. The proposed
method obtained high levels of recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score,
accordingto the ﬁndings of the study.Additionally,Wang etal.149 suggested a
urine sample-based method for detecting PD to identify speciﬁc metabolites
as biomarkers for PD and a predictive model use ensemble ML techniques.
This study identiﬁed eight metabolites that could distinguish between PD
patients and healthy people using a combination of metabolomics and ML
assessments.Based onthe results,this method had a high AUCand accuracy.
Bhandari et al.144 presented an approach for diagnosing PD using
blood-based gene data. This study employed ridge regression and LASSO
for feature selection, alongside various ML methods—particularly LR and
SVM—for data classiﬁcation. In addition, the SHAP method was used to
identify the essential genes responsible for diagnosing PD. According to the
results, the proposed method provided high accuracy. Yang and Huang150
conducted a study to evaluate the efﬁcacy of CNN and SVM in categorizing
individuals with PD based on resting-state EEG data. The results demon-
strated that the CNN approach outperformed SVM by effectively identi-
fying important features, shortening the training time, and achieving higher
levels of accuracy.
Shabanpour et al.151 developed a multivariate and data-driven model
utilizingDCNN toanalyzeEEGdataand identifyspatialoscillatorypatterns
associated with PD. The model was intended to improve understanding of
the brain physiology in PD while creating clinically interpretable topo-
graphical maps. In the same vein, Oliveira Coelho et al.152 proposed a
diagnostic model for PD using Hjorth features derived from EEG signals.
Patients with PD exposed to auditory stimuli had their data analyzed using
SVM, KNN, and RF. Results demonstrated the model’s high accuracy in
distinguishing Parkinson’s patients from healthy individuals, particularly
when SVM was utilized.
Hosny et al.153 suggested a DL model founded on CNN-GA-KNN that
improved the localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN)using local ﬁeld
potentials (LFP) in patients with PD. The suggested model used a CNN to
extract features and the GA to select features. In addition, KNN was used for
classiﬁcation. Furthermore, the results showed that this model was highly
accurate. Additionally, Martinez-Eguiluz et al.154 developed ML models for
the early diagnosis of PD using non-motor symptoms, such as autonomic
dysfunction and depression. They evaluated the models using two data-
bases, namely PPMI and Biocruces. SVM and MLP demonstrated the most
promising results among all the algorithms.
Xu et al.155 proposed a DL-based system that investigated the meta-
bolites and small molecules in saliva to detect PD at early stages (Hoehn-
Yahrstage1-2.5). Thementioned algorithmused 312 samplesfor validation
purposes, and the results demonstrated its performance in terms of AUC,
sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. Also, Zhang et al.156 introduced two methods for
classifying clinical sleep EEG data, namely wavelet packet transform with
deep residual shrinkage network (WPT-DRSN) and tunable Q-factor
wavelet transform with deep residual shrinkage network (TQWT-DRSN).
This model integrated time-frequency analysis and DL, demonstrating
promising outcomesin classifying non-stationary signals. In addition, REM
sleepbehaviordisorder(RBD)wasinvestigatedinconjunctionwithPD,and
the proposed model demonstrated high accuracy in early detection of PD
and disease tracking.
Dar et al.157 introduced an architecture called 1D-CRNN-ELM, which
combined a CRNN and an ELM to detect six fundamental emotions in
individuals with PD. The suggested architecture achieved high accuracy in
classifying emotions and showed its effectiveness in EEG-based signals
emotion recognition. Also, Nour et al.158 suggested an approach that

classiﬁed PD using ensemble learning through EEG signals. The mentioned
models were investigated in terms of several evaluation metrics, such as
kappa score, ROC curve, and accuracy, demonstrating their performance.
Moreover, Chu et al.159 offered an advanced framework for EEGmicrostates
utilizing DNN to identify patients with PD in the initial stages. Also, brain
regions were investigated for any probable relationship with PD. The
assessments depicted that the model could increase accuracy.
Lin et al.160 developed a method for assessing and estimating the
severity of impulse control disorder (ICD) comorbidity in patients with PD
using ML. Furthermore, EEG measurements were obtained utilizing an
inexpensive headset, which enabled the device to be implemented in routine
environments. Moreover, Wu et al.161 investigated the potential biomarkers
and therapeutic target genes for PD and conﬁrmed the ﬁndings using
experimental approaches. Also, this study used different ML algorithms,
includingLASSOandRF.Inanotherresearch,Ueharaetal.162introducedan
approach for diagnosing PD using sebum RNA proﬁles. In addition, they
analyzed the proﬁles using ML methods. This approach showed high AUC
(ROC). Additionally, Aljalal et al.163 demonstrated the efﬁciency of various
entropy measures and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with
MLmethodsfordiagnosingPDusingEEGdata.Also,thesuggestedmethod
showed high accuracy.
Using longitudinal data from two PDBP and PPMI cohorts, Dadu
et al.164 developed ML-based models to detect distinct subgroups of PD and
predict disease progression. Based on the study ﬁndings, AUC (ROC) was
high, indicating a framework for predicting PD progression up to ﬁve years
before diagnosis. Besides, Park et al.165 presented a cost-effective method for
predicting PD risk and enabling early detection through ML techniques and
longitudinal health screening data. Cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and
hemoglobin levels were identiﬁed as the most critical predictors. Moreover,
the proposed method achieved a high AUC (ROC) for the neural network
model. Further,Harveyetal.166 introduced an ML-based approachtoforecast
cognitive outcomes in PD patients. In addition, the proposed approach
obtained high sensitivity. Karabayir et al.167 also provided a 1D-CNN-based
method forpredictingprodromalPDuptoﬁveyearsbeforeclinicaldiagnosis
byusing 10-second ECG data.Accordingto theﬁndings,the method showed
high speciﬁcity. Moreover, Leal et al.168 developed a model to predict PD
patients who are at risk of developingdyskinesia usingclinical and behavioral
data. The presented model using the RF classiﬁer showed high AUC (ROC).
Qualitative analysis of biomarker-based approaches. We analyzed
biomarker-based approaches thoroughly and introduced their strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the classiﬁcation in the context
of PD diagnosis using ML:
• Strengths: The qualitative review led to two outcomes. First, having a
strong biological view of PD may lead to early detection of the disease.
Second, these approaches may be utilized for personal treatment and
monitoring of disease progression.
• Weaknesses: While biomarker data collection is invasive, it may result
in patient willingness to do tests. Many variables among different
populations, such as genes, may hinder the generalization of models.
These methods are expensive; indeed, they need many experts and
resources to be accomplished.

• Opportunities: Resolving these concerns may involve combining bio-
markerdatawith imaging and other clinical data, potentially leading to
higher accuracy. Employing advanced technologies and methods such
as genomics and proteomics may accelerate identiﬁcations. Moreover,
scientists may use non-invasive approaches such as saliva and urine
biomarkers to increase the willingness among patients.
• Threats: However, the quality of the collected data varies due to dif-
ferences in data collection and storage methods. Also, there are ethical
barriers to regulating and deploying biomarker data.
Multimodal
Multimodal datasets provide a complete PD diagnosis. These datasets
contain biomarkers, medical imaging, movement patterns, and acoustic
sounds. Improving the accuracy of early PD diagnosis through reﬁned ML
models requires the integration of various data input sources169, as a holistic
perspective is essential. Table 18 presents the details of the dataset, including
data collection periods, the number of participants, database names, mul-
timodal data types, and supplementary information. Table 19 covers the
multimodal dataset-based articles, including their main ideas, advantages
and limitations, applied tools, and algorithms. Furthermore, the evaluation
metrics are outlined in Table 20. In Section “Multimodal-based approa-
ches”, multimodal-based approaches are reviewed. Section “Qualitative
analysis of multimodal-based approaches” also includes a qualitative ana-
lysis of approaches, such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threats.

selection techniques and longitudinal datasets. In addition, various fea-
ture selection algorithms (FSAs), clustering, feature extraction algo-
rithms (FEAs), and classiﬁcation algorithms were utilized. Also, based on
the ﬁndings, merging non-imaging data with SPECT-based radiomic
features and the optimal use of hybrid ML systems (HMLs) enhanced the
identiﬁcation and prediction of PD subtypes in the fourth year. Similarly,
Severson et al.171 presented a statistical progression model using long-
itudinal data that accounted for intra-individual variations, medication
effects, and inter-individual differences to better understand the het-
erogeneous symptoms and progression of PD. They also used a con-
trastive latent variable model and a customized input-output hidden
Markov model as part of their method.
Junaid et al.169 proposed an interpretable ML framework that utilizes
multimodal data, including medication history, patient characteristics, and
motor and non-motor data, to detect and predict early signs of PD.
According to the results, the techniques were effective and accurate. Also,
Khera and Kumar172 proposed a hybrid strategy to classify the severity of the
PD based on ML approaches. According to the evaluation results, the model
could detect PD accurately. Pahuja and Prasad15 presented the modal-level
and feature-level frameworks based on DL architectures to improve the
diagnosisofPD.Inaddition,thisstudyusedmulti-modalfeatures,including
biological (CSF) and neuroimaging. The results also demonstrated that the
provided frameworks had acceptable accuracy.
Richa Indu et al.173 introduced a modiﬁed KNN algorithm based on
handwriting, gait, and voice parameters for PD diagnosis. The authors
enhanced this algorithm by incorporating the δ-neighborhood for pre-
dicting the class of test samples and the concept of weights. The ﬁndings
showed that the proposed approach was accurate. In another study, Sarica
et al.174 suggested an ML technique using an explainable boosting machine
(EBM) to classify SWEDD, PD, and HC. Additionally, they used imaging
and clinical data in order to train their model. Despite the relatively small
dataset, the ﬁndings demonstrated that the model performed remarkably
well, achieving a high AUC-ROC score.
Parisi et al.175 proposed two activation functions, namely quantum
rectiﬁed linear unit (QReLU) and modiﬁed-QReLU (m-QReLU), aimed at
enhancing the performance of CNN in tasks such as medical image clas-
siﬁcation, PD diagnosis, and COVID-19 detection. The results indicated
that the proposed approach exhibited high accuracy and reliability. Also,
Hajianfar et al.176 offered a hybrid ML system to detect two essential genes,
namely leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and glucocerebrosidase
(GBA), using the PPMI database to diagnose PD. Also, several feature
selection and feature extraction algorithms were used to reduce the number
of variables and tackle overﬁtting. The evaluation results demonstrated high
accuracy in performance.
Kanagaraj et al.177 offered a method for enhancing the accuracy of PD
diagnosis by utilizing PPMI data and an ant colony optimization approach.
The proposed method resulted in more accurate predictions with fewer
features, enhancing computational efﬁciency. Additionally, it demonstrated
high accuracy. Also, Aggarwal et al.178 proposed a method using 1-D CNN
and data augmentation to classify non-PD, PD, and scans without evidence
of dopamine deﬁcit (SWEDD) and avoid misdiagnosis. Their approach
achieved high-performance in precision, F1-score, recall, and accuracy. In
another study, Templeton et al.179 applied ML to classify PD and its stages
through tablet-based neurocognitive assessments. The model utilized
multimodal data, including speech, memory, evaluations of motor function,
and the CART algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved high
accuracy. Makarious et al.180 presented a model for diagnosing and mana-
ging PD before patients recognize the signs and symptoms. This method
was developed to identify PD by combining genetic, clinical, and demo-
graphic data with ML methods, such as AdaBoostClassiﬁer and GenoML.
According to the results, this method had a high AUC (ROC).
Qualitative analysis of multimodal-based approaches. Through cri-
tical review and analysis of the papers using multimodal-based approa-
ches, we listed some of the most important strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats of the classiﬁcation:
• Strengths: The primary advantage is the accumulation of both motor
and non-motor symptoms, which drives the resolution. Also, in this
category, all the forms of datasets, such as acoustic, imaging,
movement, and biomarker, are combined to increase accuracy.

• Weaknesses: However, these approaches require signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
resources, as gathering clinical data involves various tests, and
acquiring movement datasets may necessitate high-tech devices. Also,
these need to be done with substantial computational resources and
expertise, which makes the entire process too expensive.
• Opportunities: Paying attention to the mentioned scenarios may pave
the way for future researchers. Developing new fusion techniques for
multimodal datasets may optimize the process. Also, multimodal
analysis may reveal a new pattern of biomarkers that were not obvious
through single-modal analysis.
• Threats: The risk of data overﬁtting is inevitable and should be con-
sidered due to model complexity and limited data.
Analysis of results
The results of our systematic review procedure are discussed in this section.
Section “Overview of the selected studies” presents an overview of the
selected studies, while Section “Objectives” discusses the advantages, lim-
itations, and differences among the various PD datasets and ML techniques.
Analyzing classiﬁcations used in the dataset and helping to draw a future
path for researchers are the ultimate goals of this study.
Overview of the selected studies
The goal of this study is to investigate state-of-the-art PD datasets currently
used in diagnosis with the aid of ML methods. To achieve this, we have
considered the following complementary questions (CQs):
• CQ1: Which groups are actively involved in diagnosing PD with ML
applications?
• CQ2: Which publishing channels distributed the most papers?
• CQ3: How are the publications and studies distributed on diagnosing
PD with ML approaches per publisher?
• CQ4: How are the publications and studies distributed on diagnosing
PD with ML approaches per year?
• CQ5: How do the studies address the Parkinsonian syndrome classi-
ﬁcation years before diagnosing PD and performing complex
classiﬁcation tasks?
These questions aim to provide a clearer understanding of the current
landscapeofPDdiagnosisusingMLandidentifyfuturetrendsandpotential
research directions.
• CQ1: Which groups are actively involved in diagnosing PD with ML
applications?
After synthesizing and selecting the papers, we extracted the authors’
afﬁliations. Table 21 presents a comprehensive list of universities and
institutes that have contributed at least twice in this ﬁeld. Researchers from
the University of British Columbia, Canada; Skolkovo Institute of Science
and Technology in Russia; the University of Surabaya in Indonesia; RMIT
University in Australia; FAU in Germany; and Stanford University in
United States published a signiﬁcant number of research papers on PD
diagnosis through ML approaches.
• CQ2: Which publishing channels distributed the most papers?
Table 22 shows that most JCR-indexed journal papers on PD
diagnosis using ML approaches are published in BSPC, SR, NCA,
MTAP, IEEE TONSRE, IEEE JOBHI, CIBM, and NPD. Table 22
provides a list of JCR-indexed journals that have published at least
two related papers, including the publisher’s name and abbreviation,
as well as the journal’s impact factor.
• CQ3: How are the publications and studies distributed on diagnosing
PD with ML approaches per publisher?
Figure5 presents the distributionofpublishersacrossthe given subject
annually. Figure 5A shows that Elsevier is the leading publisher,
accountingforoverone-thirdofthereviewedpapers.Insecondplaceis
Springer with 31%, followed by IEEE with 17% and Nature with 11%.
Wiley has contributed 4%, and both Taylor & Francis and ACM each
have a share of 1% of the total publications. Figure 5B–E showed the
trends and number of studies about diagnosing PD with ML over the
mentioned timeline based on publishers.
The charts show that Wiley published four papers in 2021, while only
two were published in 2023. Moreover, Elsevier’s contribution was
greater over these years, except in 2024, when only two papers were
published by April. Springer maintained a steady pace, contributing at
least ten papers annually, except in 2024, with only 5 papers published
untilApril2024.Meanwhile,IEEEshowedacontributionin2023,with
a total of 12 publications. In 2021, Nature published only one paper,
while during the rest of the timeframe, it showed a steady contribution
ofatleastfourpapersannually.Ontheotherhand,ACMandTaylor&
Francis have the smallest share of releases, with just one publication
each, making them the two publishers with the fewest papers.

2024. In the year 2023, the total number of papers reached its highest point
of 43. Even though just 11 papers were published up to April 2024, the
research in this ﬁeld is improving.
• CQ5: How do the studies address the Parkinsonian syndrome classi-
ﬁcation years before diagnosing PD and performing complex
classiﬁcation tasks?
According to Fig. 6, of the 133 studies reviewed, only 20% focused on
the early diagnosis of PD, and none speciﬁcally addressed the classiﬁcation
of Parkinson’s syndromes. This highlights a signiﬁcant gap in research
within this ﬁeld. While many studies focused on binary classiﬁcation tasks,
such as distinguishing between PD and HC, these approaches may not
adequately capture the complexity and challenges involved in clinical
diagnosis. In complex cases such as those mentioned, there is a need for
longitudinal datasets and subtle signal changes. Future research should
focus on the Parkinsonian syndrome classiﬁcation years before diagnosing
PD to increase the real-world effectiveness of ML in PD diagnosis.
However, several studies2,4,15,54,59,65,71,72,77,87,92,124,130,134,143,148,154–156,164,165,167,
169,170,174,179,180 also focus on more complex tasks, such as diagnosing the
early stages of PD using non-motor symptoms. These symptoms
include olfactory impairment, depression, rapid eye movement, sleep
behavior disorder (RBD), and data obtained from fMRI, saliva, or blood
tests. Additionally, research has aimed to identify PD from similar
conditions, such as SWEDD. These approaches highlight the potential
of ML to tackle various diagnostic challenges beyond simple binary
classiﬁcation.
Table 23 shows that the acoustic data and biomarkers category con-
tains the most papers on the early diagnosis of PD, while the medical
imaging category has the fewest articles.
Objectives
In this section, we answer some research questions by providing sta-
tistical and analytical investigation results according to Section
“Planning”.
• RQ1: What types of datasets are used to diagnose PD?
In our detailed reviewin Section “Classiﬁcation of the selectedstudies”,
we have distinguished the datasets used in the papers into ﬁve discernible
categories–namely movement information, medical imaging, acoustic

information, biomarkers, and multimodal– which has been provided in
Fig. 4.
• RQ2: Which category of datasets is used the most to diagnose PD?
Based on our detailed review in the fourth section and the answer to
RQ1. This paper categorizes datasets into ﬁve groups. According to Fig. 7,
about 25% of the studies utilized movement data, while acoustic data was
slightly less common, appearing in 23% of the cases. Medical imaging and
biomarkers jointly ranked in the third place with two tenths, respectively.
Also, multimodal with 11% is a novel approach that drives scientists’
attention.
• RQ3: What tools are used the most in assessing ML approaches in
diagnosing PD?
Figure 8 shows a collection of the tools demonstrated in Tables 6, 9, 12,
15 and 18. It shows the wide range of software and tools that experts have
used in their work. Python ranks the most considerable proportion,
accounting for 42% of usage, closely followed by MATLAB at 23%. R was
usedin8%ofthestudies,whileFSL,with3%,wasallocatedtheshortestrank.
This data provides insight into the preferred computational tools in ML for
assessing PD.
• RQ4: What metrics are signiﬁcantly used to assess the ML techniques
in diagnosing PD?
Applying ML for PD diagnosis has been assessed using various tech-
niques and measures. The measures include accuracy, TPR (sensitivity),
precision, TNR, F1-score, AUC (ROC), and MCC. Tables 7, 10, 13,
16 and 19 offer thorough assessments applied in review papers. In addition,
Tables 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 detail the beneﬁts and downsides of each cate-
gorization approach. For a more detailed view, our statistical analyses are
visually represented in Figs. 9 and 10, which show the comprehensive
percentage distribution of the evaluation metrics and the parameter esti-
mations by category, respectively. Figure 9 indicates that accuracy is the
most frequently reported metric, representing 20% of the cases, followed by
sensitivity at 18%. Precision, F1-score, and speciﬁcity are also signiﬁcant,
with 12% each. At the same time, balanced accuracy stood at the lowest end
with only 1%.
According to Fig. 10, Studies involving acoustic data mostly focused on
accuracy(21.13%),witha similarlystrongemphasis onSensitivity(20.42%).
A minor 9.86% of studies considered AUC (ROC), and none of the papers
evaluated balanced accuracy. As the focus shifted to movement data, about
one-ﬁfth of papers aimed to enhance accuracy. In medical imaging, the
focus on accuracy peaked at 18.05%, and sensitivity reached 17.29%, while
AUC and balanced accuracy were considered in 9.02% and 0.75% of the
studies, respectively. Biomarker research displayed accuracy with 21.74%
derived the most attention; also, AUC received signiﬁcant attention at
18.26% compared to another group. When it comes to multimodal, accu-
racyaccountedfor 21.05% of studies. However, balanced accuracy rated just
3.51%, and it was the highest among other categories. This suggests a
relatively balanced focus across evaluation metrics. Across all ﬁelds, accu-
racy consistently emerged as a critical metric in PD detection using ML
approaches, although other metrics, such as balanced accuracy, F1-score,
and AUC, might better represent model performance.
The focus on some evaluation criteria for ML models in PD diagnosis
may lead to an inadequate evaluation of the model’s actual performance.
Figure 9 indicates that accuracy is the most frequently used criterion,
warranting further investigation. Focusing insufﬁciently on class balance in
the imbalanced dataset can reduce the effectiveness of accuracy as a per-
formance evaluation metric. In medical data, the number of positive cases
(patients) is typically much lower than that of negative cases (non-patients).
Using accuracy as a metric does not effectively reﬂect a model’s ability to
identify minority classes correctly. Balanced accuracy is a more suitable
measureforevaluatinganimbalanceddataset,whichappearedinonly1%of
the reviewed articles. Similarly, F1-score and AUC (ROC) are widely used
but remain less common than accuracy. Many reviewed papers in our study

used techniques such as oversampling, class weighting, and robust algo-
rithms to handle imbalanced data. Although accuracy and F1-score are
often preferred due to their ease of use, it is imperative to employ more
robustmeasuressuchasbalancedaccuracyandAUC(ROC)toassessmodel
performance fully.
• RQ5: What ML algorithms have been considered the most in
diagnosing PD?
Figure 11 shows the several ML approaches that signiﬁcantly impact
the diagnosis of PD. In this paper, we provide information based on the
following categories: DL algorithm, regression algorithm, ensemble algo-
rithm, reduction algorithm, clustering algorithm, ANN, optimization
algorithm, feature selection algorithm, signal processing algorithm, and
others. Figure 11 demonstrates that the most frequently used algorithms
among all published papers were DL algorithms, which had a 20% share,
followed by ensemble algorithms with 16%. SVMs, with 12%, ranked third
in usage. Algorithms such as ANN, optimization, reduction, and regression
algorithmseachhadusageratesrangingfrom7%to9%.Incontrast,theleast
utilized approaches were signal processing techniques, clustering algo-
rithms, and feature selection methods, with usage rates of 1%, 1%, and 2%,
respectively.
Inaddition,thealgorithmicadvantagesacrossdifferentstudytopicsfor
PD diagnosis are clearly shown in Fig. 12A–E. Figure 12A shows that DL
was the most frequently used algorithm, appearing 16 times across the
studies. Ensemble methods, SVM, ANN, and optimization algorithms fol-
lowed, with usage rates of 12%, 11%, 10%, and 9%, respectively. Regarding
medical imaging, DL algorithms recorded the ﬁrst usage with 21 instances,
according to Fig. 12B, while the reduction algorithm had the lowest usage.
Figure 12C shows that both the DL algorithm and the ensemble algorithm
were each used 17 times, whereas feature selection received the lowest
contribution ranking. In the biomarker category (Fig. 12D), ensemble
algorithms had the highest usage with 17 instances, followed by DL with 13,
SVM with 11, and reduction algorithms with 10. In the ﬁnal section of the

ﬁgure, the ensemble ranked ﬁrst, followed closely by regression algorithms
in second place.
• RQ6: What validation methods are used in studies diagnosing PD
with ML?
Figure 13 highlights that the reviewed studies commonly employ
evaluation methods such as cross-validation and train-test split. About 49%
of the studies used cross-validation to evaluate model performance. A total
of 29% of the studies used Train-Test Split as an evaluation method, and
only19%usedindependenttestsetstotestthegeneralizabilityofthemodels.
This is considered a signiﬁcant limitation in evaluating the generalizability
of the models. Furthermore, 3% of the studies did not directly mention the
assessment method, raising concerns about the reliability of the results. As a
result of the lack of transparency in this ﬁeld, the model’s performance in
real-life conditions may be overestimated. In general, data leakage is a
common pitfall in ML studies. This occurs when the model unintentionally
learns from information in the test dataset. To ensure the reliability of the
results, appropriate methods for data segmentation and careful evaluation
strategies should be employed.
Open issues, challenges, and future trends
• RQ7: What are the major challenges, future trends, and open issues in
diagnosing PD with ML?
We propose future research areas categorized into three groups: open
issues, future trends, and challenges, see Fig. 14. This is motivated by the
growingneedtoidentifyclinicalandpracticalapproachesfordiagnosingPD
using ML, as well as the review and analysis of data from selected papers.
Each group is detailed below. The primary challenge in diagnosing PD via
ML approachesis the absence of a predeﬁned method, making it essential to
employ ML approaches to evaluate clinical and non-clinical data from
potentialpatients,healthyindividuals,andthosealreadydiagnosedwithPD.
Therefore, managing data imbalance, regulating and normalizing, and
overcoming ethical and legal obstacles remain the primary issues in this
subject. Additionally, several problems in PD diagnosis remain unresolved,
including the lack of advanced methods, the limited use of wearable tech-
nology, non-generalizable datasets, and insufﬁcient language diversity in
voice datasets. Furthermore, prospects for future research include the use of

genetic data, 3D dopamine imaging, and multimodal analysis. This intro-
duction is followed by a detailed discussion of the challenges, potential
developments, and unresolved concerns.
Open issues
• GeneralizableDatasets:Manyresearchhavepointedoutthatthereisan
abundance of appropriate datasets for their evaluations8,57,72,77,84,86,91,
97,102,113,115,117,122,124,127–129,131,134,135,139,147,148,150,151,153,154,174,175. In ML, one of the
most fundamental principles is that the more data available for train-
ing, the more accurate model’s results will be. In addition, the authors
did not assess their ML methods on any other datasets. The absence of
evidence demonstrating the performance of the models on other data
types may have resulted in misleading ﬁndings, even if the models may
have performed successfully on some of them. Consequently, larger
and more diverse cohorts should be included in research to ensure that
the results are both reliable and generalizable to a broader population.
The low sample sizes and lack of generalizability might represent an
ongoing, unresolved issue.
• Model Generalization: The capacity of models to generalize across
diverse demographic and clinical contexts is a common source of
worry. Indeed, the lack of thorough investigation using varied datasets
limits our understanding of how well these models perform under
diverse conditions. To address this, researchers are looking at ways to
strengthen models by cross-validation and verifying them on different
external cohorts106,115,117,130,147,148,150,151. Consequently, this ongoing issue
may play a signiﬁcant role in future research.
• Lack of advanced analysis: The needfor more advancedanalytical tools
to manage complicated data aspects, particularly non-linear correla-
tions and interactions among variables, is often brought up in
discussions. This open issue will be discussed often by advocating the
use of advanced ML and DL frameworks. This will allow for a better
grasp of the intricacy involved113,115,117,119,123,124,127–131,133–135,140,172.
• Limited language diversity: Most of the presented models, which ana-
lyzevocaldatasets73,74,77,138,haveonlybeenassessedbyasinglelanguage,
which again may produce inaccurate ﬁndings since other languages
were unable to operate well with their models. Indeed, the amount of
sound that may be made in different languages is varied; as a con-
sequence, their method and results are only valid for a restricted
number of individuals. In addition, the ethnicity and race of the par-
ticipants have not been explored as a parameter in almost all of the
datasets.Thesetwofactorshaveadirectbearingontheconclusionsthat
may be drawn about a PD diagnosis since members of the same
populationmightexhibitsymptomsofthisdiseaseinthesamemanner.
This open issue should be resolved to obtain more reliable results.
• Personalized treatment: The development of predictive models using
ML has the potential to signiﬁcantly enhance the early identiﬁcation
andtreatmentof PD,eventuallyleadingtoimproved patientoutcomes.
Among the signiﬁcant challenges that still need to be solved is the
development of individualized prediction models that account for
speciﬁc characteristics of an individual, such as their age, gender,
medical history, genetics, and lifestyle variables. The possible outcome
of this is that it might lead to more accurate predictions and improved
treatment programs that are speciﬁcally customized to meet the
requirements of those who are at risk for developing PD. Speciﬁcally,
studies74,128,151 raised questions in this regard.
• Wearable technologies: ML can evaluate patient body vibrations and
wearable sensor data to diagnose better and monitor illness develop-
ment. Another unresolved challenge is using wearable devices that

continually monitor motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients
and giving real-time data to dynamically change therapy. Wearable
sensors, such as smart watches, smart bands, and other available
wearable sensors9,181–183, can be utilized as a straightforward and
accessible diagnostic tool for PD. Nevertheless, substantial work
remains in this area. Wearable devices for continuous monitoring pose
challenges such as ensuring data accuracy, enhancing patient comfort
to improve compliance, securing sensitive health data, extending
battery life, and effectively integrating collected data into clinical
practice. Addressing these challenges is essential for using wearables to
monitor PD and other neurological disorders, enhancing treatment
options and patient outcomes. A gadget should be comfortable,

washable, and able to detect sickness phases and drug effects. For
example, a wearable wristband collects data continuously over time
and identiﬁes the various symptoms of PD74,122,131,135.
• Multimodal analysis: Multimodal ML algorithms are one way to use
data from multiple datasets to diagnose PD more accurately. The
method incorporates data from multiple datasets, such as wear-
able sensors, medical imaging, and clinical data, and optimized
algorithms for each source. Although there are several studies on
various biological signals to evaluate mobility impairments in PD
patients, most studies only analyze a single method. Literature
indicates that the multimodal method is more precise than uti-
lizing each method independently. For example, in184 and185, the
authors assessed existing PD staging systems and determined that
incorporating additional modalities and functionalities beyond a
single modality, such as motor symptoms, is essential. This
approach would enable a more objective scoring system, leading to
a more comprehensive evaluation of patients’ symptoms and
facilitating personalized treatment for each individual186. In gen-
eral, existing signal processing and classiﬁcation techniques
incorporating data from many sensors have not been adequately
evaluated. Although signiﬁcant progress has been documented in
multiple studies, there is currently no multimodal fusion system
that can accurately forecast illness severity and track disease
progression8,62,92,102,119,131,140,174. This open issue may play a vital role
in future research.

Challenges
• Data availability: The limited availability of comprehensive datasets of
good quality hinders research endeavors. Obtaining longitudinal data,
diverse patient groups, and multimodal datasets that include clinical,
genetic, and imaging data is a signiﬁcant difﬁculty for many research
studies. The majority of currently available data are either difﬁcult to
proprietary or access, belonging to hospitals or enterprises, and not
openly accessible. This challenge affects the robustness, general-
izability, and depth of researchﬁndings. Without diverse and extensive
datasets, researchers cannot validate their models across different
conditions, leading to less reliable and applicable results.
• Regularization and normalization: The regularization and normal-
ization processes are crucial DL tools for PD identiﬁcation. These
strategies ensure the model learns valuable medical data patterns,
improves generalizability, and prevents overﬁtting. This improves
diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Even if these methods are not
adopted widely by the DL research community, they have the potential
to become a fruitful ﬁeld of study in the following years.
• Handling data imbalance: An issue that often arises is the presence of
imbalanced datasets, in which certain classes or outcomes are under-
represented. As a consequence of this imbalance, models may be
slanted toward the class that comprisesthe majority. This, in turn, may
have an effect on the accuracy of projections produced for under-
represented groups within the population. The inability of a model to
accurately represent minority groups might result in diagnostic tools
that are less practical and clinical insights that are prejudiced130,154,175.
• Computational resource limitation: Advanced ML and DL methods
often require substantial computational resources, which may not be
available in all research settings, particularly in smaller clinics or
institutions in developing regions. This restricts the ability of some
researchers to employ the most advanced methodologies, potentially
leading to slower progress or less innovative outcomes.
• Ethical and regulatory hurdles: In the healthcare industry, obtaining
authentic patient data while safeguarding privacy is a signiﬁcant
challenge. This difﬁculty is compounded by the lack of balanced
neurological disease datasets, which can adversely affect the efﬁciency
of ML models. Furthermore, there are many obstacles to overcome
when negotiating the ethical and regulatory environment, particularly
when working with sensitive health data and using AI-driven
technologies in clinical settings. The time required to obtain necessary
approvals and ensure compliance with ethical standards and
regulations can delay research progress and the implementation of
ﬁndings in clinical practice.
• Clinical adoption and usability: Designing tools and models that are
technically sound, user-friendly, and practically applicable in clinical
workﬂows is a common obstacle. Even with strong technical perfor-
mance, the lack of usability and integration into clinical practice can
limit the adoption and impact of research innovations.
• Real-testbedevaluation:ClinicaltestingandevaluationofMLmodelsis
essential. The move from controlled research to real-world clinical
practice involves signiﬁcant problems. To ensure these models are
productive and safe in real-world settings, patient variety, data
heterogeneity, and ethical implications must be considered. Data
scientists and healthcare practitioners must collaborate to create
clinically relevant and accurate models. Healthcare experts can
illuminate PD diagnosis, patient care, and the nuances of the disease.
Early identiﬁcation and management of PD can improve the lives of
patients with this severe disorder.
• Robust validation methods: To address the identiﬁed methodological
challenges,futurestudiesshouldemphasizerobustvalidationmethods,
such as external validation using completely independent datasets and
k-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, clear documentation of the data
preprocessing process, and the dataset segmentation methods is
essential to reduce the risk of data leakage. The use of standard datasets
to compare model performance, along with advanced techniques such
as nested cross-validation, can enhance the validity of results. By
concentrating on these methods, researchers can contribute more
effectively, repeatedly, and transparently to this ﬁeld.
Future trends
• Multimodal brain MRI: By revealing the structural and functional
changes in the brain associated with PD, multimodal brain MRI can
enhance the accuracy of PD diagnosis. In addition to aiding in early
diagnosis and identifying prodromal stages of PD, advanced MRI
techniques—when analyzed with ML— can improve diagnostic pre-
cision by integrating additional data layers from various MRI
modalities187. Moreover, integrating MRI data with additional bio-
markers, such as blood or cerebrospinal ﬂuid indicators, through the
use of ML models has the potential to dramatically improve the early
identiﬁcation and differential diagnosis of PD. The combination of
multimodal MRI and ML offers new avenues for improving PD
diagnosis.
• 3D Dopaminergic imaging: Future research in PD should focus on
developing 3D Dopaminergic imaging to map brain dopamine activity
more precisely. This method has the potential to increase the accuracy
of early diagnosis, develop individualized treatment methods, and
evaluate the effectiveness of treatment procedures in real-time. While
accurate visualization of dopaminergic neurotransmitter oscillations is
expected to enhance the diagnosis of PD progression, it may also aid in
the development of more effective medicines. To gain a better
understanding of PD diagnosis and progression, three-dimensional
maps of dopaminergic neurotransmitter activity in the brain are
produced using advanced imaging methods87,104.
• Genetic and biomarker discovery: Future research on PD should focus
on genetic proﬁling and biomarker discovery to enhance diagnostic
precisionandpersonalizedtreatments.Researcherscanidentifyunique
genetic markers and better understand their inﬂuence on disease
progression and treatment response by analyzing genetic data across
diverse populations and correlating it with clinical outcomes. Through
the use of this integrated method, new treatment targets may be dis-
covered, enabling earlier diagnosis and more successful, individualized
therapy of PD. To facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis, it is
necessary to carry out genetic proﬁling to ﬁnd biomarkers predictive of
the progression of PD54,86,96,102,107,144.
• Drug effect: The use of ML in research on the inﬂuence of medications
on neuromelanin in PD has the potential to dramatically improve the
accuracy and speed of these studies. ML algorithms can analyze
complex imaging data to ﬁnd subtle changes in neuromelanin content
and distribution in the SN as a result of therapies. These algorithms
may be trained on datasets that are generated by modern 3D imaging
techniques,whichenablesmoreaccuratesegmentationand analysis.In
addition, ML models may be evaluated over a wide variety of external
cohorts to evaluate their robustness. This helps ML models to accu-
rately predict and generalize the effects of drugs on neuromelanin. This
approach has the potential to develop therapeutic solutions that are
more precisely targeted and a more comprehensive understanding of
the progression of PD87.
• Symptom variability: The diagnosis of PD and the subsequent sur-
veillance of its progression may prove challenging due to the extensive
range of individual symptoms. As a result of the fact that symptoms
might differ in terms of their presentation, frequency, and intensity,
developing an applicable diagnostic paradigm remains a challenging
endeavor. This issue may be resolved, and PD diagnosis and therapy
could be signiﬁcantly enhanced by integrating a variety of data types
into ML models. These data types may include imaging data, audio
recordings, and clinical evaluations. The evaluation of all the patient
symptoms can lead to the development of more personalized and
effective medicines.

• Advancing early detection and classiﬁcation: Future studies should
prioritize the early detection of PD before severe symptoms appear, as
well as the differentiation of various Parkinson’s syndromes.
Researcherscanimprovegeneralizationacrossdifferentpopulationsby
employing longitudinal data and multimodal datasets, along with
advanced ML approaches, such as transfer learning and ensemble
methods. Additionally, exploring tasks beyond simple binary classiﬁ-
cation—such as tracking disease progression and classifying subsets—
holds signiﬁcant potential for enhancing clinical applications.
• Adoption of evaluation metrics: A robust evaluation criteria selection is
essential for the development of PD diagnosis models. Although
accuracy is widely used as a metric, its limitations in imbalanced
datasets highlight the need for alternative evaluation measures. Studies
should focus on metrics such as F1-score, balanced accuracy, AUC
(ROC),and MCC,whichprovidea more comprehensive assessmentof
model performance and address the imbalanced class. Furthermore,
researchers should justify their selection of speciﬁc criteria to enhance
transparency and improve research reproducibility. This approach
leads to standardization of reporting criteria and facilitates compar-
ability of results among various studies.
Threats to validity and limitations
This study aims to offer a systematic and comprehensive review that
compares and classiﬁes various ML methods for diagnosing PD. Although
the result of SLR is typically reliable from different aspects188, having lim-
itations in these papers is inevitable34. Consequently, the most substantial
limitation of this study has been highlighted below.
• Papers were selected from multiple well-known databases, including
Elsevier, IEEE, Taylor & Francis, Springer, ACM, Nature, and Wiley,
but we cannot certify thatallrelated papers were selected. As a result, as
described in Stage 3.2 of the conducting phase, it is possible that some
articles were overlooked throughout the paper selection process.
• We classiﬁed the selected papers into ﬁve groups: acoustic data, bio-
markers, movement data, medical imaging, and multimodal dataset.
There could be alternative potential categorization, though.
• This SLR is organized around six fundamental questions, while there
may be other important inquiries to consider.
• DespitetheextensiveliteratureonusingMLapproachesfordiagnosing
PD,thisSLRfocusedonpaperslistedintheJCR,disregardingreputable
conference papers. Furthermore, articles published nationally, book
chapters, short papers, conference papers, editorial papers, and works
written in languages other than English were not considered.
• This SLR can be considered highly credible due to the deﬁned review
protocol, adherence to a systematic process, and collaboration with
multiple researchers in this research.
Conclusion
A comprehensive SLR in diagnosing PD based on ML is conducted in this
study. This paper examines the use of well-known ML algorithms, as well as
the employed datasets, repositories, applied tools, evaluation factors, valida-
tion methods, and relevant algorithms, comparing their advantages and
disadvantages. In the ﬁrst phase, 729 papers were collected based on a
research query from 2021 to April 2024. The top 133 papers were chosen for
the investigation based on methodology and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Elsevier and Springer together constitute two-thirds of the proportion in this
ﬁeld, with the former accounting for 35% and the latter for 31% of the
contribution.Nature contributed only 11% of the papers. A fraction of a sixth
of all publications will be devoted to the IEEE. On the other hand, Taylor &
Francis and the ACM each recorded the least share, reaching barely one
percent. Our study addressed a signiﬁcant gap in research on early detection
ofPD,asonly20%ofthereviewedarticlesfocusedonthisaspect.Weoffereda
category in which the selected papers were organized into ﬁve unique groups:
acoustic data (23%), biomarkers (20%), medical imaging (20%), movement
data (26%), and multimodal (11%). Statistical analysis reveals that 20% of the
papers aimed to improve accuracy, while 18% focused on enhancing
sensitivity. Python and MATLAB were the preferred tools, with 42% of
publications using Python and 23% using MATLAB. The most commonly
used algorithms were DL-based algorithms, which utilized in 20% of the
selectedpapers.Basedonthereviewedpapers,nearlyhalfofthestudies(about
49%) utilized cross-validation methods to assess model performance, while
29% depended on the train-test split technique. The study emphasized open
challenges and future trends in identifying PD using ML techniques. Open
issues in thisﬁeld includegeneralizable datasets,model generalization, lack of
advanced analysis, limited language diversity in vocal datasets, personalized
treatment, wearable technologies, and multimodal analysis. Additionally,
signiﬁcant challenges in this ﬁeld, include data availability, regularization and
normalization, handling data imbalance, computational resource limitation,
ethical and regulatory hurdles, clinical adoption and usability, and real-
testbed evaluation. Future trends may focus on multimodal brain MRI, 3D
dopaminergic imaging, genetic and biomarker discovery, drug effect, and
symptom variability.
