Abstract: Our previous studies demonstrated that a prototype photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound
(US) imaging catheter can differentiate intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. However, its
compatibility with clinical endoscopic procedures has not been validated. Here, we present a
translational PA-US dual-modality imaging catheter with a reduced diameter to fit the biopsy
channel of standard adult colonoscopes and therapeutic upper endoscopes (∼3.7 mm). The
catheter integrates an angle-tipped optical fiber (600-µm core) for PA illumination and a
miniaturized 48-element ultrasound array operating at a center frequency of ∼9 MHz for signal
reception. These components are enclosed in a hydrostatic balloon (12 mm diameter, 15 mm
length when fully inflated) to ensure acoustic coupling with the intestinal lumen. The system was
upgraded from our previous setup by incorporating a more portable optical parametric oscillator
(OPO) laser and a Verasonics imaging platform. The imaging catheter was positioned at the
disease locations in a pig model of esophageal fibrosis induced by argon plasma coagulation
(APC). Multi-wavelength PA imaging and US imaging were performed to resolve the tissue
components. The results demonstrate the catheter’s ability to assess inflammation and fibrosis in
the gastrointestinal tract during a standard clinical endoscopy procedure.

Introduction
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel condition characterized by a combination
of inflammation, fibrosis, and muscular hypertrophy, which cause intestinal strictures [1,2]. CD
strictures can occur at any location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus to the anal
canal [3,4]. Differentiating between inflammatory and fibrotic strictures is critical for effective
clinical management. Inflammatory strictures often respond to medical therapy, while fibrotic
ones usually need surgery [5,6]. Current diagnostic tools, including endoscopic biopsies, mainly
assess the superficial mucosal layers of the GI tract [7,8]. However, these methods do not evaluate
the deeper submucosal and muscularis propria layers, where fibrostenotic changes such as fibrosis
and muscular hypertrophy primarily develop in Crohn’s disease (CD) [9]. Because these deeper
alterations define stricturing CD, relying only on superficial biopsies may underestimate disease
severity and lead to suboptimal treatment decisions [10].
To address this limitation, noninvasive imaging modalities, including x-ray computed tomogra-
phy (CT) [11], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [12,13] and ultrasound (US) imaging [14–17]
have been investigated to assess transmural involvement and characterize stricture composition.
Although these modalities offer valuable structural and morphologic information, none can

resolve molecular components like hemoglobin and collagen that are characteristic of increased
intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, respectively.
To fill this diagnostic gap, our previous studies investigated the feasibility of photoacoustic
(PA) imaging for characterizing the biochemical composition of Crohn’s disease lesions in vivo
[18]. By quantifying hemoglobin and collagen, PA imaging enables clear differentiation between
inflammatory and fibrotic tissues [19]. We developed a capsule-shaped, acoustic-resolution PA
endoscope capable of longitudinal scanning and demonstrated its utility in assessing intestinal
strictures in rabbit models [20]. This system provided high-resolution imaging of hemoglobin
and collagen under both ex vivo and in vivo conditions, revealing disease progression from acute
inflammation to chronic fibrosis [20]. In another study, an endocavity PA and ultrasound (US)
parallel imaging system was established and translated to human subject studies [21]. To reach
deeper along the gastrointestinal tract, colonoscope-compatible catheters were developed [22–24].
However, all of these imaging devices produce superficial imaging that does not penetrate the
submucosal layer where intestinal fibrosis occurs. Our prototype PA-US dual-modality balloon
catheter, integrating a hydrostatic balloon for acoustic coupling and a miniaturized linear US
array for tomographic PA imaging, demonstrated penetration up to 12 mm [25]. In addition, none
of these studies evaluated the catheter within an actual clinical endoscopy workflow.
This study introduces a further miniaturized and translational PA-US imaging catheter
compatible with the instrument channel of clinical endoscopes. The imaging system was
upgraded from our previous version by incorporating a compact optical parametric oscillator
(OPO) laser (Opolette UX1020, Opotek Inc., USA) for improved portability. Using this system,
we performed imaging experiments using a pig model of upper GI tract strictures [26,27]. The
pig esophageal model developed by Selaru offers several advantages over rodent models. These
include the formation of strictures with marked fibrosis and a tendency to recur after standard
therapeutic treatment, histological features similar to lower GI strictures, physiological similarity
to humans, and a body size suitable for clinical endoscopes [26].
Using the pig model, quantitative multi-wavelength PA signal analysis allowed in vivo
assessment of tissue hemoglobin and collagen content. Our results demonstrate the translational
potential of this approach for diagnosing and monitoring CD-related strictures [20,25,28].

Methods
2.1.
Imaging system update
The imaging system was adapted from our previously developed PA-US setup, which integrates a
Verasonics Vantage 256 platform (Verasonics Inc., USA) for PA and US data acquisition. In this
study, the system was upgraded by incorporating a lightweight and tunable optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) laser (Opolette UX1020, Opotek Inc., USA), capable of providing nanosecond
emissions across a broad near-infrared range (650–2400 nm) at a maximum energy of 11 mJ per
pulse and a 20 Hz repetition rate. The portable design facilitated a small system footprint in
clinics. PA signals were received by a linear ultrasound array embedded in a custom-designed
catheter. The laser was externally used to trigger the Verasonics system to ensure synchronized
signal acquisition. Simultaneously, ultrasound B-mode images were acquired to provide an
anatomical reference. The PA and US dual-modality imaging system and pig in vivo experimental
setup are shown in Fig. 1.
2.2.
Balloon catheter fabrication
Figure 2(a) shows the schematic diagram of the balloon catheter. The design is similar to that
described in our previous study [25]. The catheter integrates an angle-tipped optical fiber for
PA illumination and a high-frequency US array for PA signal reception, both enclosed within a
hydrostatic balloon to optimize acoustic coupling. The US array is custom-made (Vermon, Tours,

France) and features a 48-element linear ultrasound array with a pitch of 100 µm and a center
frequency of approximately 9 MHz. The array has a flexible catheter shaft with an outer diameter
of 2 mm and a length of 2 meters, which is slimmer and longer than the commercial US catheter
used in our previous study [25]. The angle-tipped and side-firing optical fiber (FT600EMT,
600 µm core diameter, NA = 0.39, Thorlabs, NJ) was integrated alongside the array to deliver
photoacoustic illumination [25]. The imaging elements were enclosed within a transparent
water-inflatable balloon (inflated diameter ∼12 mm, length ∼15 mm), which provided stable
acoustic coupling with the tissue interface. A heat-shrink tube (03-0663, Nordson Medical, Ohio,
USA) encases the US array and optical fiber. As shown in Fig. 2(b), one end of the heat-shrink
tube connects to the hydrostatic balloon, and the other end connects to a three-way stopcock.
Inflation and deflation of the balloon were performed using a hydrostatic pump connected to the
3-way stopcock. By filling degassed water through port 3 and extracting air from port 2, the air
inside the balloon and heat-shrink tubing was purged. Figure 2(c) and 2(d) show the balloon at
the distal end of the assembled catheter before and after water inflation, respectively.
Spatial resolution of the system was evaluated using a 200 µm diameter polyethylene wire.
The wire was positioned at the balloon surface, perpendicular to the imaging plane and centered
laterally. Figure 2(e) shows the PA image of the cross-section of the diameter polyethylene
wire. The signal-to-noise ratio is 19 dB. The point spread function was derived by deconvoluting
the image in Fig. 2(e) with the physical cross-section profile of the polyethylene wire. The
lateral and axial profiles of the point spread function in Fig. 2(f) show that the axial and lateral
spatial resolutions of the system at the balloon surface are 104 and 143 µm, respectively. These
results confirm that the new array provides resolution comparable to our prototype system with a
commercial US transducer array [25].
2.3.
APC pig esophageal fibrosis model
Esophageal strictures were induced using a thermal injury model, originally described by Selaru
[26]. This model uses argon plasma coagulation (APC) to create superficial, full-circumferential
burns of the esophageal mucosa. After a 14-day healing period, fibrotic strictures developed,
localized to the APC sites interspersed with normal esophagus.

Female, healthy domestic pigs weighing 30 to 50 kg (White Yorkshire x Landrace, Oak Hill
Genetics, Ewing, IL, USA) were acclimated for at least 3 days prior to any experimental procedures.
Pigs were fasted overnight prior to anesthesia induction and subsequent endoscopic and PA
procedures. Prophylactic pain medication and anti-emetics were given to reduce discomfort. All
endoscopic procedures were performed using an Olympus endoscope (model CF140L, Olympus
Corporation, Center Valley, PA, USA) under general anesthesia in the Animal Surgical Operating
Room (ASOR) facility at the University of Michigan.
The endoscope was advanced through the mouth and into the pig’s esophagus. All endoscopic
procedures were video recorded. Baseline photoacoustic imaging was performed at multiple
interspersed locations 25 to 55 cm from the incisors. An ERBE probe (Erbe USA, Marietta, GA)
was inserted into the endoscope and into the esophageal lumen. Full circumferential lesions of
∼1 cm in length were created using short (1 to 5 second) bursts of APC using an argon flow
rate of 0.5 L/min and 50 Watts of power. 3 to 4 APC lesions, interspersed by a minimum of
10 cm of uninjured esophagus, were created per pig. Animals were recovered from anesthesia
and returned to housing.
Pigs received a liquid diet for 1-day post-procedure then advanced to standard solid food.
Post-procedural pain was managed with anti-emetic and anti-inflammatory drugs as needed. As
APC burn injury can induce nausea and gastroesophageal reflux, each pig received daily oral
esomeprazole. Daily monitoring for potential complications such as bleeding or perforation
was performed during the first 5 days post-procedure, then thrice weekly unless clinical status
changed. Pigs that exhibited decreased oral intake or vomiting/regurgitation were provided a

liquid or combination liquid/solid diet as tolerated. After a 7-to-14-day healing period post-APC,
the pigs were sedated prior to endoscopy and photoacoustic imaging.
At the end of the study (day 7 to 28) pigs were euthanized to allow histological assessment
of the esophagus. Swine were euthanized by barbiturate overdose followed by a secondary
terminal method in compliance with the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) policy, the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, and the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines.
All animal procedures were performed under PRO00011639 in accordance with the USDA
Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations (AWAR).
2.4.
In vivo imaging procedure
This study includes four pigs with a total of 24 locations (12 APC lesions and 12 untreated
(normal) locations). Figure 3 shows the endoscopic procedures. The APC-treated locations
were first identified using white light endoscopic imaging. The PA-US balloon catheter was
inserted through the instrument channel. The balloon was then inflated with degassed water to
establish acoustic coupling with the esophageal wall. Photoacoustic images were acquired with
multi-wavelength illuminations at 800 and 1310 nm at a frame rate of 20 Hz. Ultrasound B-mode
images were collected 20 µs after the photoacoustic frames.

Histology
The pig esophagus from ∼1 cm distal to the soft palate to ∼1 cm proximal to the lower esophageal
sphincter was dissected, rinsed, and photographed. Sections corresponding to the PA-US imaging
locations were collected, rinsed, and fixed in 10% formalin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining and Masson’s trichrome staining were performed by the University of Michigan Cancer
Center Histology and Immunoperoxidase Lab (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and McClinchey Histology
Lab (Stockbridge, MI, USA), respectively. Digital photomicrographs of proximal and distal
esophageal sections were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope at the University of
Michigan Microscopy and Image Analysis Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Inflammation and fibrosis were scored separately in a blinded manner by a board-certified
veterinary pathologist (YL) at magnifications ranging from x20 to x600. Inflammation was
assessed on H&E-stained slides, while fibrosis was evaluated on Masson’s trichrome-stained
slides. Slides were scored on a 0 to 4 scale for inflammation and fibrosis. The histological
scoring system is included as Supplement 1.

Data quantification and statistics
To evaluate the ability of the imaging system to resolve molecular composition in esophageal
tissue, 800 nm and 1310 nm were selected to target the distinct optical absorption features of
hemoglobin and collagen. The optical energy distribution compensation and spectroscopic
unmixing were implemented on the beam-formed PA images pixel-wise [29]. The relative
concentrations of the chromophores were solved using a linear least-squares fitting algorithm and
optical absorption coefficients of the chromophores [23,24] below:
Spectral basis =
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
0.2520
0.0063
0.0022
1.0000
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
where each row corresponds to the optical absorption coefficient of hemoglobin and collagen
at 800 and 1310 nm, respectively [26]. Quantified relative total hemoglobin and collagen
concentrations were extracted from the regions of interest (ROIs) within the esophageal wall at
each imaging location, guided by anatomical US images to ensure consistency across animals
and groups. Signal distributions were analyzed across individual pigs and esophageal positions.
For group-wise comparisons, data were organized by experimental condition (e.g., baseline,
untreated control positions, and APC-treated locations) and visualized using bar graphs and box
plots.
All statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests for comparisons between groups at individual chromophores [30,31]. The Wilcoxon test
does not assume normality and is more robust than a parametric t-test for small sample sizes
and discrete pathological grades that may not follow a normal distribution. All data processing
and statistical computations were carried out in MATLAB R2022b. Statistical significance was
indicated using asterisks as follows: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***), and p ≥0.05
was considered not significant (n.s.).

Results
3.1.
Histological inflammation and fibrosis in the pig APC model
To provide validation of the PA-US imaging of the molecular components of inflammation and
fibrosis, normal and APC-treated sections of the pig esophagus were scored for histological
inflammation and fibrosis in a blinded manner and illustrated in Fig. 4. A mixture of histological
inflammation and fibrosis was observed in APC-lesions as compared to the normal untreated
esophagus by blinded histopathological analysis. Substantial inflammation was observed in the
esophageal APC-treated lesions compared to normal, untreated locations (0.1 vs. 2.2, p < 0.001).
Histological fibrosis was more variable but was significantly higher in the APC-lesions than in
the untreated locations (0.25 vs. 1.89, p < 0.001).
3.2.
Consistency of PA imaging
Figure 5 shows the average multispectral PA signal magnitudes of the esophageal wall at different
locations within the same animal. At both wavelengths, the PA measurements at the untreated
positions show minimal changes compared to those at the APC-treated locations. The baseline
and untreated locations produced PA signals with magnitude variations within a small range.
The APC-treated locations exhibit PA signals with increased magnitudes and larger variations.
Quantitatively, the standard errors of the PA signal magnitudes at 800 nm were 1.21%, 1.91%, and
3.04% of the average magnitudes at baseline, untreated, and APC-treated locations, respectively.
At 1310 nm, the standard errors were 0.77%, 3.05%, and 4.59% of the averages. The root-mean-
square differences between measurements at the untreated positions and baseline measurements

at the same positions were 1.03% of the average at 800 nm and 2.33% of the average at 1310 nm.
This observation confirms that the imaging system produces consistent measurements.

Structural and molecular imaging of the pig esophagus using PA and US
Figure 6 shows representative B-mode US and spectrally-unmixed PA images of the pig esophagus
acquired at baseline, untreated control locations, and treated locations 14 days after APC-treatment.
The US image shows increased thickness of the APC-treated esophageal wall compared to the
baseline. Both hemoglobin and collagen content are found extensively within the esophageal
wall. An additional observation found in the US images is the elevated echogenicity within
the APC lesion. This may be associated with increased stiffness due to fibrosis, which was
reported in rat and human subjects in our previous studies [28,32,33]. Histological sections
stained with Masson’s trichrome (right-most column, blue staining) demonstrate a dramatic
increase in collagen content. The observed distributions of hemoglobin and collagen in the PA
images correspond well with the inflammatory and fibrotic features seen in histology.

Statistical results
Figure 7 summarizes the relative tissue components derived from PA measurements from multiple
untreated and APC-treated locations in all four animals. Baseline and untreated locations did
not differ in either hemoglobin or collagen relative concentration. Compared to the baseline,
the APC-treated locations showed an increase of 3.12 units in hemoglobin (p < 0.001, Fig. 7(a)),
and an increase of 8.58 units in collagen (p < 0.001, Fig. 7(b)). In addition, the APC-treated
locations showed a higher hemoglobin content of 3.53 units (p < 0.001, Fig. 7(a)), and a higher
collagen content of 8.18 units (p < 0.001, Fig. 7(b)) than the untreated control locations. These
results align with the tissue component changes in the representative case shown in Fig. 6. The
APC-treated locations exhibit significant variations (2.54 units in hemoglobin content and 2.50
units in collagen content) compared to the baseline and control groups, which align with the
histology scoring.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that dual-modality PA-US imaging, implemented through a balloon-
integrated catheter, can be incorporated into an endoscopic workflow compatible with current
clinical practice. The further miniaturization of the US array enables the fully assembled imaging
catheter to fit the diameter and the length of the instrument channel of clinical colonoscopes.

The updated US array showed comparable performance to the commercial US array used in
the previous version. The results show a comparable signal-to-noise ratio and image quality
compared with the previous study [25,28].

Considering factors such as sterilization and wear through the instrument channel, the
catheter developed in this study is designed for single use. With mass production, the cost of
catheter devices, such as dilation balloon catheters and intracardiac ultrasound catheters, can be
significantly reduced and widely accepted in clinical practice.
The white light endoscopic imaging successfully guided the positioning of the imaging catheter.
The imaging catheter demonstrated sufficient penetration through the esophageal strictures,
providing spatially resolved molecular component information in the deep layers in the GI tract,
which is not possible with biopsies and other existing imaging modalities. This workflow enables
clinicians to make therapeutic decisions on diseased locations during the endoscopy procedure,
eliminating the time delay associated with histological processing of biopsy tissues.
This study was limited to imaging the upper GI, which differs from the lower GI in anatomy,
physiology, and immune function. While the primary drivers of fibrosis differ between the pig
thermal injury model and human CD, as well as the upper and lower GI, the pathophysiology
involves similar biochemical pathways, including the TNFα (inflammatory) and TGFβ (fibrotic)
[34]. Both upper and lower GI strictures are characterized by an early inflammatory response with
increased vascularization, followed by pathological wound healing characterized by increased
collagen deposition and subsequent tissue contraction. While GI strictures involve a complex
interplay of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, this study is limited
to measuring basic molecular components of hemoglobin (surrogate for inflammation) and
collagen (surrogate for fibrosis), but does not measure the immune response, collagen types, or
organization. The histology scoring is limited to validating the effectiveness of APC in producing
fibrosis in the esophagus. One-to-one correlations between the PA measurement and histology
were not calculated, as exact registration between the PA imaging location and histological
section is not possible due to the constraints of tissue harvest and processing.
Some of the esophageal strictures in the swine model have large lumens. This may also occur
in human subjects where the disease conditions are not symptomatically severe. In these cases,
the catheter surface must be pressed against the lumen surface for reliable acoustic coupling. In
our future work, we will prepare catheters with a selection of balloon diameters. The clinician

will be able to choose an appropriate size before inserting the imaging catheter. Calibration of
the optical energy dispersion and attenuation through balloons of varying sizes will be performed
for comparable measurements.
The higher echogenicity of the stricture prompts future work on measuring the mechanical
properties using the US elastography [33] or strain-PA imaging [35] employed in our previous
studies. By combining the mechanical properties with the spectroscopic molecular information,
the imaging catheter may introduce a powerful tool for the diagnosis of CD and other diseases
throughout the GI tract.
5.
Conclusions
This study presents a dual-modality photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging catheter compatible
with standard clinical endoscopy. The balloon-based design provides stable acoustic coupling
and enables real-time acquisition of structural and molecular information during endoscopic
procedures. In a porcine model, the system detected changes in hemoglobin and collagen
content associated with inflammation and fibrosis, with elevated collagen signals following
APC treatment. These findings support the integration of spectroscopic PA-US imaging into GI
workflows for noninvasive assessment of tissue fibrosis. Future work will incorporate anti-fibrotic
interventions to evaluate treatment efficacy.
