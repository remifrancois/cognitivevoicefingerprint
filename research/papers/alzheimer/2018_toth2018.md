Abstract: Background: Even today the reliable diagnosis of the prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD) remains a great challenge. Our research focuses on the earliest detectable indicators of cogni-
tive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Since the presence of language impairment has been 
reported even in the mild stage of AD, the aim of this study is to develop a sensitive neuropsychological 
screening method which is based on the analysis of spontaneous speech production during performing a 
memory task. In the future, this can form the basis of an Internet-based interactive screening software 
for the recognition of MCI.  
Methods: Participants were 38 healthy controls and 48 clinically diagnosed MCI patients. The provoked 
spontaneous speech by asking the patients to recall the content of 2 short black and white films (one di-
rect, one delayed), and by answering one question. Acoustic parameters (hesitation ratio, speech tempo, 
length and number of silent and filled pauses, length of utterance) were extracted from the recorded 
speech signals, first manually (using the Praat software), and then automatically, with an automatic 
speech recognition (ASR) based tool. First, the extracted parameters were statistically analyzed. Then 
we applied machine learning algorithms to see whether the MCI and the control group can be discrimi-
nated automatically based on the acoustic features.  
Results: The statistical analysis showed significant differences for most of the acoustic parameters 
(speech tempo, articulation rate, silent pause, hesitation ratio, length of utterance, pause-per-utterance 
ratio). The most significant differences between the two groups were found in the speech tempo in the 
delayed recall task, and in the number of pauses for the question-answering task. The fully automated 
version of the analysis process – that is, using the ASR-based features in combination with machine 
learning - was able to separate the two classes with an F1-score of 78.8%.  
Conclusion: The temporal analysis of spontaneous speech can be exploited in implementing a new, 
automatic detection-based tool for screening MCI for the community.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a quite distinct neurodegen-
erative disorder that develops for years before clinical mani-
festation. Although it has been extensively researched, un-
certainty regarding the diagnosis of its prodromal stages still 
exists. However, the symptoms of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) might be detected years before the actual diagnosis 
[1]. This tells us that the clinical appearance of AD is pre-
ceded by a prolonged, preclinical phase. Hence, early diag-
nosis and timely treatment are very important, as the pro-

gression can be slowed down and the occurrence of new 
symptoms can be delayed [2]. 
MCI is a heterogeneous syndrome that has a clinical im-
portance in the early detection of both AD [3] and the pro-
dromal state of dementia. MCI often remains undiagnosed, 
as recognizing cognitive impairment is challenging for clini-
cians at any stage of the disease: up to 50% of even later 
stage dementia fails to be recognized [4]. Widely used 
screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) are not sensitive enough to reliably detect subtle 
impairments present in patients with early-stage MCI. Lin-
guistic memory tests like word list and narrative recall are 
more effective in the detection of MCI, but they tend to pro-
duce undesired false positive diagnoses [5].

A Speech Recognition-based Solution for the Automatic Detection 
Current Alzheimer Research, 2018, Vol. 15, No. 2    131 
MCI is known to influence the linguistic abilities of the 
patient in the following aspects: temporal changes in sponta-
neous speech [5-11], phonemic paraphasia [7, 9, 10, 12-14], 
word retrieval and word finding difficulties [11, 15-20] and 
verbal fluency difficulties [5, 10, 17, 21-25]. Although lan-
guage impairment has been known to occur early in the dis-
ease process [26], only minimal attention has been paid to a 
formal language evaluation when diagnosing AD [27]. Since 
language impairment has been reported even in the mild 
stage of AD, we recently developed a sensitive neuropsy-
chological screening method that is based on a memory task, 
triggered by spontaneous speech [7]. In the future, this ap-
proach might from the basis of screening for MCI through a 
computerized, interactive test implemented as a software 
package [28]. 
MCI is known to influence the (spontaneous) speech of 
the patient via three main aspects [11]. Firstly, the verbal 
fluency of the patient deteriorates, which results in distinc-
tive acoustic changes – most importantly, in longer hesita-
tions and a lower speech rate [9, 10]. Secondly, as the patient 
has trouble finding the right word, the lexical frequency of 
words and part-of-speech tags may also change significantly 
[19, 20, 29]. Thirdly, the emotional responsiveness of the 
patient was also reported to change in many cases. There are 
attempts to detect these changes based on the paralinguistic 
and prosodic features of the patient’s speech [30-34]. 
The goal of the study we present here was twofold. First, 
we sought to find acoustic (temporal) parameters that have a 
high correlation with MCI. For this, our starting point was 
our earlier study, where we examined the speech of AD pa-
tients [7]. There we compared the articulation rate, speech 
tempo, hesitation ratio, and rate of grammatical errors of AD 
patients versus a normal control group. Our results showed 
that these acoustic parameters may have a diagnostic value 
for mild-stage AD and thus can be viewed as acoustic bio-
markers of AD. Here, we perform the statistical evaluation 
of a similar set of temporal features, but in this case on the 
speech recordings of MCI patients. 
The manual extraction and analysis of the temporal fea-
tures can be very informative regarding the acoustic corre-
lates of MCI. However, performing the same analysis for 
each new patient for diagnostic purposes would be very time 
consuming. Hence, finding ways of automating the feature 
extraction process would be vital. Furthermore, if the diag-
nostic decision process could be automated as well, then the 
corresponding algorithms could form the basis of a fully 
automatic screening test. 
The simplest way of automating the feature extraction 
procedure is to apply signal processing methods. With these, 
one can separate voiced and voiceless segments, speech and 
non-speech, or periodic-aperiodic parts [9, 30]. However, the 
precise measurement of temporal features such as articula-
tion rate would require the use of automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) tools. Several researchers have already used ASR 
in the detection of dementia or MCI, but they usually applied 
off-the-shelf ASR solutions [5, 10, 19, 35]. In this study, we 
present an ASR system that was especially tailor-made for 
detecting our acoustic biomarkers. The most important dif-
ference is that, instead of minimizing the word error rate, our 
system focuses on finding the phones. Even more unusually, 
our biomarker extraction step requires the ASR only to find 
the phone boundaries, as the actual phone labels are not re-
quired by the feature extraction procedure. A further differ-
ence compared to standard ASR solutions is that finding and 
identifying filled pauses is important for us, while these 
segments are usually filtered out from a standard ASR output 
as garbage. More details and explanation will be given in 
Sections 3 and 4. 
The second step of automation is to obtain a diagnostic 
decision algorithmically. For this purpose, we applied ma-
chine learning technologies. Based on the manual labeling 
(yes/no diagnosis) of our MCI and control patients, we 
trained the Weka machine learning toolkit [36] to distinguish 
the two classes. We performed this classification experiment 
with both the manually and the automatically extracted fea-
tures, in order to see how the two feature sets compare. 
The structure of this article is as follows. First, we pre-
sent the subjects and the data acquisition method in Section 
2. We introduce our set of temporal features and perform 
statistical analysis on them in Section 3. In Section 4 we pre-
sent our method for the automation of feature extraction us-
ing ASR, and in Section 5 we attempt to automatically clas-
sify MCI cases using machine learning methods. Lastly, in 
Section 6, we make some concluding remarks. 
2. SUBJECTS AND DATA COLLECTION 
A total of 84 subjects participated in the study. From this, 
48 persons were MCI patients and 36 were healthy controls. 
All the 48 subjects with MCI were right-handed, native 
speakers of Hungarian and they also had a negative medical 
history for hearing impairment. They were also free of any 
medication that might influence cognitive functions in any 
way. The healthy control (NC) group included 36 partici-
pants, who were also right-handed, native speakers of Hun-
garian. The NC group did not differ significantly from the 
MCI group in either gender ( χ2-test, p=0.791) or years of 
education (t-test, p=0.0807). As regards age, the MCI group 
differed significantly from healthy controls (t-test, p = 
0.0322). That is, subjects older than 71 years were more 
likely to belong to the MCI group. The following clinical 
tests were applied to assess the cognitive state of the sub-
jects: Clock Drawing Test [37], Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion [38], ADAS-Cog [39]. The state of depression was as-
sessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The main statis-
tical properties of the MCI and the control group are summa-
rized in Tables 1a and 1b. 
All the tests were carried out at the Alzheimer Disease 
Research Centre of the University of Szeged, Hungary. The 
research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Uni-
versity of Szeged, and all experiments were conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The linguistic protocol of collecting the speech samples 
from the subject consisted of the following steps. After pre-
senting a specially designed one-minute-long animated 
movie, the subjects were requested to talk about the events 
they saw to happen the film (Task 1 - “immediate recall”). 
After this, we asked the subjects to describe their previous 
day (Task 2 - “spontaneous speech”). Finally, as the last 
task, a second film was presented, and the subjects were

asked to talk about this film after a one-minute long distrac-
tion (Task 3 – "delayed recall"). This way, we obtained three 
recordings from each subject, corresponding to the three 
different tasks. The recording was performed with an Olym-
pus WS-750M digital voice recorder and a König tie clip 
microphone. The sound samples were recorded in wma for-
mat, which was later converted into an uncompressed PCM 
mono, 16-bit wav format with a sampling rate of 16000 Hz. 
3. MANUALLY EXTRACTED TEMPORAL FEA-
TURES 
After a careful listening, the recordings were transcribed 
both orthographically and phonetically. The manual analysis 
of the signals was carried out with the help of the PRAAT 
software (www.praat.org, [40]). The acoustic parameters we 
examined are the temporal variables listed in Table 2. We 
mention that hesitation was defined as the absence of speech 
for more than 30 ms [41]. 
Notice that while the first three features focus on the 
phonetic content of the signals, the remaining five features 
try to extract information about the pauses found in the re-
cordings. However, hesitations do not necessarily mean si-
lent pauses, but can also correspond to filled pauses where 
the speaker hums, or produces other hesitating sounds (uhm, 
er, etc.). Hence, we decided to calculate the last five features 
both for silent and filled pauses separately. Furthermore, we 
also calculated them with both types of pauses taken into 
account. Hence, these five features resulted in fifteen values, 
so altogether with the first three features we extracted eight-
een features from each utterance. 
It should be mentioned that, technically speaking, the 
calculation of the acoustic parameters requires the precise 
placement of the phonetic segment boundaries, and the iden-
tification of each segment as pause, filled pause or phoneme. 
Hence, the manual processing step using PRAAT basically 
consisted of the phonetic segmentation and labeling of the 
utterances. We will try to replace this manual process by 
speech recognition methods in Section 4.

3.1. Statistical Analysis of the Features 
In order to investigate the importance of each feature, we 
carried out a statistical analysis. We applied the t-test to each 
temporal feature for each task and compared the data from 
the MCI group to those got from the NC group. The t-test 
applied was a one-tailed t-test for unpaired samples and une-
qual variances. Table 3 shows the p-values for each parame-
ter and for each of the three tasks. The cases where the dif-
ference between the two groups is significant (i.e. where p < 
0.05) are marked in bold. 
Our analysis found that duration, the total length of silent 
pauses and the (total) length of pauses indicated significant 
differences between controls and MCI patients for all the 
three tasks. As for articulation rate, speech rate and the ratio 
of pauses and duration, there were significant differences

task 2. The number of silent pauses and pauses differed sig-
nificantly in tasks 1 and 2, whereas the total length of filled 
pauses showed significant differences in tasks 2 and 3. 
There were also certain parameters that were significant 
only in the case of one of the tasks. Namely, the number of 
filled pauses and the ratio of filled pauses and duration 
showed significant differences only in task 2, while the ratio 
of silent pauses and duration, the average length of silent 
pauses and the average length of pauses were significant 
only in task 3. 
4. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF ACOUSTIC BIO-
MARKERS 
In the last section we saw that the majority of the tempo-
ral features examined correlate with the diagnosis of MCI, so 
they might be regarded as acoustic biomarkers of MCI. 
However, extracting these biomarkers manually is rather 
tedious and requires skilled labor, as their calculation is 
based on the phonetic segmentation of the recordings. In this 
section we present our special, speech recognition-based 
solution for the automatic extraction of the relevant acoustic 
features. But before doing this, we will give a brief overview 
of the related studies found in the literature. 
 
4.1. Related Work 
The simplest way of automating the feature extraction 
procedure is to apply signal processing methods. For exam-
ple, signal processing algorithms can be used for the separa-
tion of voiced and voiceless segments, for finding the silent 
sections of a recording, or for the extraction of prosodic fea-
tures. Satt et al. derived continuity features from the dura-
tions of contiguous voice and silence segments, and from the 
lengths of periodic and aperiodic segments. They separated 
the voiced and the silent segments using a simple voice ac-
tivity detection algorithm, based on the pitch-synchronous 
intensity curve of the recorded speech signal. The periodic 
and aperiodic segments were detected based on the pitch 
contour. They calculated these features using the PRAAT 
software, and intentionally avoided speech recognition tools 
in order to keep their system language-independent [9]. De 
Ipiña et al. also applied Praat to cut the acoustic signal into 
voiced and voiceless segments. They applied an automatic 
voice activity detector for this purpose, and they represented 
the segments by creating a statistics of their duration, short-
term energy and the location of spectral centroids [30]. Rap-
can et al. separated the speech and non-speech parts of the 
input signal using relatively simple signal processing meth-
ods. They employed a thresholding method to the energy

contour of the speech signal, and also applied an edge detec-
tion algorithm to find the boundaries of breath sounds. An 
important novelty of this paper is that the authors recognized 
that elongated breaths may correspond to filled pauses, and 
thus they may be discriminative features in the cognitive 
function. Based on this observation, Rapcan et al. took spe-
cial care to separate breath sounds from speech [42]. 
The advantage of the above-mentioned signal processing 
methods is that they are relatively simple, and also largely 
language-independent. However, extracting features like 
periodicity/aperiodicity can give only a rough estimate of 
such temporal features like the rate of speech. Moreover, as 
Fraser et al. correctly note, these simple techniques cannot 
distinguish filled pauses from speech, so they will find only 
the silent pauses [43]. An alternative option is to involve 
automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools in the process of 
feature extraction. This approach is language-dependent, but 
allows the precise calculation of phone duration-based 
measures. Baldas et al. proposed the use of ASR for tran-
scribing the speech signal, and extract lexical features from 
the transcripts that may help the early detection of AD. 
However, they did not apply the ASR to extract acoustic 
features, and their short conference paper contains no ex-
perimental results [29]. Lehr et al. also applied ASR in the 
detection of MCI, but similar to Baldas et al., they employed 
the ASR only to obtain an orthographic transcript, and not 
for the purpose of extracting acoustic features. We note that 
their ASR system produced relatively large word error rates 
(between about 30% and 50%), and the error rates were sig-
nificantly higher for the MCI group than for the control 
group [35]. Fraser et al. applied the off-the-shelf ASR tool of 
Nuance in the diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia. 
They argued that the accuracy of ASR systems for elderly 
voices usually decreases with the age of the speaker, and that 
speech recognition can be even more challenging in the pres-
ence of linguistic impairments [43]. Roark et al. extracted 
temporal features that are very similar to the ones we pro-
pose here, for example, the pause rate and the phonation rate. 
They also made use of an ASR tool in the extraction of the 
features. However, in their case the transcript is obtained 
manually, and ASR is applied only for creating a forced time 
alignment. Hence, their approach allows only the automation 
of narrative recall tests in the best case [5]. The closest study 
to ours is that of Jarrold et al, who applied ASR to extract 
both acoustic and lexical features. Their acoustic feature set 
consisted of duration-based measures like the duration of 
consonants, vowels, pauses, and other acoustic-phonetic 
categories. However, they did not turn special attention to 
handling breaths or any other types of filled pauses [10]. 
Here, however, we apply a dedicated ASR tool which was 
adapted to the special needs of extracting the acoustic fea-
tures discussed in Section 3. We explain the specialties of 
our ASR system below. 
4.2. Extracting the Features using a Dedicated ASR Tool 
As we have seen, some authors already attempted to use 
an ASR tool as part of the feature extraction process. How-
ever, using off-the-shelf ASR software (similar to that used 
by Fraser et al. [43]) may be suboptimal. The explanation is 
that standard speech recognizers are optimized to minimize 
the number of transcription errors at the level of words, 
while here we want to extract non-verbal acoustic features 
such as the rate of speech or the duration of pauses. Note, for 
example, that none of our acoustic features require the actual 
identity of the phones; instead, we need only to count them, 
and to measure their duration. Furthermore, the filled pauses 
do not appear explicitly in the output of a conventional ASR 
system, while for our purposes they convey an important 
piece of information. Also, our data collection method – 
Task 2 in particular – would require a domain-independent 
or "open-domain" ASR software. Because of the highly ag-
glutinative nature of Hungarian, such recognizers do not yet 
exist for Hungarian, and the few exceptions (like Google's 
free ASR tool) work with a surprisingly large word error rate 
[44]. In addition to this, the speech of dementia patients has 
been observed to contain an increased amount of agrammati-
cal sentences and incorrect word inflections [19, 43]. Prepar-
ing a standard ASR system to handle all these non-standard 
errors would require a statistical model of the language of 
demented people, for which our sample set was definitely 
too small. Moreover, similar studies that experimented with 
the automatic recognition of the speech of MCI patients re-
ported quite large word error rates in the range of 30 to 50% 
[35]. 
Because of the reasons presented above, we decided to 
create a dedicated version of our speech recognizer that has 
been tailored to the special requirements of the task. Rather 
than producing a word-level transcript, it provides only a 
phone sequence as output, which includes filled pause as a 
special ‘phone’. Of course, the recognition of spontaneous 
speech of elderly people is known to be relatively difficult 
[43, 45]. Doing this only at the phonetic level, that is, with-
out restricting the vocabulary obviously increases the num-
ber of recognition errors. However, as we already pointed 
out, many types of phone recognition errors do not harm the 
extraction of the acoustic indicators. Hence, the main ques-
tion of our experiments was whether our acoustic features 
(and the subsequent classification step described later) toler-
ates the inaccuracies introduced by switching from the man-
ual to the automatic extraction method. 
The technical details of how we constructed our dedi-
cated ASR system is as follows. To train the speech recog-
nizer we used the BEA Hungarian Spoken Language Data-
base [46]. This database contains spontaneous speech, simi-
lar to the recordings collected from the MCI patients. We 
used approximately seven hours of speech from the BEA 
corpus, mostly recordings from elderly persons, in order to 
match the age group of the targeted MCI patients. Although 
the BEA dataset contains spontaneous speech, its original 
annotation did not perfectly fit our needs. It contained the 
word-level transcript of the utterances, but the filled pauses 
and other non-verbal audio segments (coughs, laughters, 
sighs, breath intakes etc.) were not or improperly marked. 
Thus we adjusted the annotation of the recordings to our 
needs. This mainly consisted of extending the transcripts by 
annotating filled pauses, breath intakes and exhales, laughter, 
gasps and coughs in a consistent manner. 
We rained the ASR system to recognize the phones in the 
utterances, where the phone set was extended to include the 
special nonverbal labels mentioned above. For acoustic 
modeling we applied a special convolutional deep neural

network (CNN) based technology. With this approach we 
achieved one of the lowest phone recognition error rates ever 
reported on the TIMIT database [47]. As a language model 
we applied a phone bigram, which is a very simple statistical 
model that estimates the probability of the next phone based 
on the actual one. Naturally, these phone bigrams also in-
cluded the non-verbal audio tags mentioned earlier. The 
ASR system outputs the phonetic segmentation and labeling 
of the input signal, including the filled pauses. Using this 
output, the acoustic biomarkers we introduced in Section 3 
can be easily extracted by performing simple calculations. 
More technological details on our ASR solution can be 
found in our conference paper [48]. 
5. CLASSIFYING MCI VIA MACHINE LEARNING 
Our final goal is the development of a software applica-
tion that would allow the users to self-test themselves for 
MCI. Depending on the results of the test, the program 
would suggest the subject to visit a neurologist to go through 
a more detailed examination. To create such a piece of soft-
ware, not only the feature extraction process but also the 
decision making step needs to be automated. We made the 
decision making procedure automatic using machine learn-
ing as follows. The values of the acoustic features are for-
warded to a machine learning method, which classifies the 
patient as either having MCI or not. The manually extracted 
feature values were at our hands for all the test files, so the 
classification results produced by the machine learning on 
this feature set were used as our baseline. We repeated the 
feature extraction step using the ASR tool, and we compared 
the resulting accuracy scores with the baseline. 
For machine learning, we applied the Weka tool, which is 
a free and open-source collection of machine learning algo-
rithms [36]. As our dataset was very small, we restricted 
ourselves to simpler classification methods, namely Naive 
Bayes, linear SVM and Random Forests. Naive Bayes is a 
natural choice in the case of very small datasets, as it has a 
very efficient modeling strategy to alleviate the so-called 
"curse of dimensionality" [49]. We chose SVM because it is 
one of the most popular classification methods in bioinfor-
matics [50]. Finally, Random Forest is a relatively new clas-
sification algorithm which is also known to be robust in the 
case of limited data, but its modeling strategy is much more 
sophisticated than that of Naive Bayes [51, 52].  
The technical details of training Weka for the MCI classi-
fication task are as follows. We treated the three utterances 
of each patient as one training sample, so altogether we had 
84 training samples. The goal of training was to decide 
whether a given speaker has MCI or not, which results in a 
2-class classification task. As for each subject we had three 
recordings collected from the three different tasks, by con-
catenating the eighteen biomarkers shown in Table 2 we 
obtained 54 feature values per subject. From a machine 
learning perspective, this dataset is rather small. Unfortu-
nately, the number of diagnosed MCI patients is quite lim-
ited, and it is tedious to collect recordings from them. All the 
similar studies we found worked with fewer than 100 pa-
tients [5, 9, 10, 35, 43]. 
Having so few examples, we did not form separate train-
ing and test sets, but applied the so-called leave-one-out 
method. This means that we withheld one example (i.e. one 
subject), trained our classifier on the remaining ones, and 
then evaluated the model on the withheld sample. We re-
peated this step for all the examples and finally aggregated 
the resulting accuracies into one final score.  
From Weka, we used the implementations called Naive-
Bayes, SMO and RandomForest. We applied Naive Bayes 
with its default settings; for Random Forest we used 100 
decision trees, while we varied the number of randomly cho-
sen features (on which these trees were trained on). We used 
SVM with a linear kernel, and varied the C complexity meta-
parameter in the range of 10-5 to 102. The optimal meta-
parameters for the Random Forest and SVM methods were 
found by iterating through these fixed sets and choosing the 
value that produced the highest F-measure. 
The choice of evaluation metric is not an easy and clear-
cut issue for this task. From a machine learning perspective, 
we can apply standard information retrieval metrics: preci-
sion measures what percentage of the MCI detections corre-
spond to real MCI cases (true positives per true plus false 
positives), whereas recall tells us what percentage of the real 
MCI occurrences were detected (true positives per true posi-
tives plus false negatives). For those who prefer to express 
the performance of the classifier by just one number, the 
standard choice is the F-measure (or F1-score), which is the 
harmonic mean of precision and recall. Lastly, as in this case 
the class distribution is quite balanced, optimizing for accu-
racy (defined as the number of correctly classified examples 
over the total number of examples) makes sense as well. 
Readers coming from the field of biomedicine might be 
more familiar with the terms sensitivity (the same as recall) 
and specificity (false positives per true positives plus false 
negatives), and might also be interested to see the ROC 
curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) 
values. We list all these metrics in the tables, and also show 
ROC curves for the sake of completeness, but we stress that 
during training the parameters were chosen to optimize the 
F1-score of the MCI class. Hence, the other metrics may not 
be perfectly optimal due to the well-known tradeoff between 
specificity and sensitivity (or precision and recall). 
5.1. Classification Results and Discussion 
Table 4 shows the classification accuracy measures ob-
tained using all the features extracted. We compared the per-
formance of three classifier algorithms – Naive Bayes, SVM 
and Random Forest - using the manually and the automati-
cally extracted features. It can be seen that, for the manually 
extracted feature set, SVM outperformed both Random For-
est and Naive Bayes. However, Random Forest worked 
somewhat better than SVM with the automatic feature set. 
Hence, while Naive Bayes performed clearly the worst for 
both features sets, we cannot draw a definite conclusion as 
regards which machine learning algorithm - SVM or Fandom 
Forest - is more suitable for the given classification task. 
Comparing the two feature sets, the best accuracy scores 
attained (with Random Forest for the automatic features, and 
with SVM for the manual features) are equivalent (71.4%), 
and the F1-score with the automatic features is slightly better 
(76.0% vs. 75.0%). The fact that the F1-scores and accuracy

scores achieved with the automatically extracted feature set 
are competitive with the scores of the manually calculated 
features demonstrates that our approach of using ASR tech-
niques for feature extraction is viable. 
Comparing the precision and recall values, the Random 
Forest method shows a clear preference for the automatic 
feature set, as the recall values are the same, while the preci-
sion is higher. The case of SVM is not that clear as it gives a 
higher recall for the automatic features set, and a higher pre-
cision for the manual set. In this case the ROC curve is 
worth examining, as it allows the evaluation of a classifier at 
various true and false positive rates. Figs. (1a, 1b, 1c) show 
the ROC curves of the three classifiers. In the case of the 
Naive Bayes classifier, the automatic feature set is worse 
than the manual one in almost all cases, and this fact is also 
clearly reflected by the corresponding AUC value in Table 1. 
However, none of the curves have a clear dominance in the 
case of the SVM and the Random Forest classifiers, and the 
best AUC values are also very close (70.8% for the manual 
and 69.9% for the automatic feature set). 
Lastly, we performed an experiment where we removed 
those features that were found not to be significant in Section

A Speech Recognition-based Solution for the Automatic Detection

3.1. This way, from the 54 features only 26 were retained 
(cf. Table 2). The machine learning methods were applied 
the same way as before. Table 5 shows the classification 
accuracy values obtained using only the statistically signifi-
cant features. 
In the case of the SVM classifier, we obtained slightly 
worse results compared to using all the features, which, in 
our opinion, reflects the fact that SVM could make use of 
even those features which did not display a statistically sig-
nificant difference among the two groups. On the other hand, 
the performance of the Random Forest classifier slightly 
improved with the reduction of the feature set. In summary, 
the best F1-score we could achieve is 78.8% with the auto-
matic features (reduced feature set, Random Forest classi-
fier), and 75.0% for the manual features (full feature set, 
SVM classifier). The achieved F1-score of 78.8% is far better 
than what a random guesswork would give, and we hope that 
with future refinements our approach will serve as the start-
ing point for developing a fully automatic MCI screening 
software package. 
CONCLUSION 
Here, we performed a statistical analysis of a previously 
proposed acoustic feature set on the spontaneous speech of 
MCI patients. The analysis indicated that the speech rate the 
number and duration of silent and filled pauses, and some 
other derived features behave significantly differently for 
MCI patients than those for control people, and hence these 
features can be used as acoustic biomarkers to strengthen the 
diagnosis of MCI. We also went one step further, and intro-
duced a speech recognition based method for the automatic 
extraction of these features. Lastly, we attempted to auto-
mate the diagnosis as well, using machine learning methods. 
In our experiments, we were able to separate the MCI pa-
tients from the control group with an F1-score of 78.8% us-
ing only automatically extracted features and automatic clas-
sification.
