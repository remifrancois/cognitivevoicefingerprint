Abstract
With the growing prevalence and incidence of heart failure worldwide, investigation and 
development of new therapies to address disease burden are of great urgency. Gene therapy 
is one promising approach for the management of heart failure, but several barriers currently 
exclude safe and efficient gene delivery to the human heart. These barriers include the anatomical 
and biological difficulty of specifically targeting cardiomyocytes, the vascular endothelium, and 
immunogenicity against administered vectors and the transgene. We review approaches taken to 
overcome these barriers with a focus on vector modification, evasion of immune responses, and 
heart-targeted delivery techniques. While various modifications proposed to date show promise 
in managing some barriers, continued investigation into improvements to existing therapies 
is required to address transduction efficiency, duration of transgene expression, and immune 
response.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a leading global health concern with worldwide prevalence currently 
ranging from 25–65 million reported cases [1,2]. In the United States, HF prevalence in 
populations aged over 60 years is 7.5% and 3.9% for men and women, respectively, and 
approximately half of all HF patients die within five years of their initial hospitalisation 
[3]. In a 2019 study of 13 European countries, the Heart Failure Association’s (HFA) Atlas

project approximated a median HF prevalence of 17 per 1000 individuals across these 
countries [4]. Australia’s prevalence of HF has been reported to range between 1% and 
2% [4]. Globally, the prevalence of HF is expected to continue to rise because of longer 
life expectancies and increases in the ageing population [4]. Thus, effective prevention and 
treatment strategies are greatly needed to reduce the growing burden of HF.
Gene therapy has made considerable progress toward clinical translation in the past few 
years and several therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) or are pending approval for different diseases. These include several antisense 
oligonucleotide therapies [5], four small interfering RNA therapies [6], and three adeno-
associated virus (AAV)-based drugs including onasemnogene abeparvovec for the treatment 
of spinal muscular atrophy (Type 1) [7], voretigene neparvovec-rzyl gene therapy for the 
treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy [8], and etranacogene 
dezaparvovec for the treatment of haemophilia B [9]. Australia has also approved the use 
of gene therapies such as talimogene laherparepvec, a herpes oncolytic virus with GM-CSF 
gene for treatment of malignant melanoma [10], nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide in 
spinal muscular atrophy type I, II, or IIIa, and voretigene neparvovec [11]. Unfortunately, 
cardiac gene therapy has not yet reached this phase of approval, and existing data suggest 
that delivering genes to the human heart is an extremely challenging task [12]. In fact, the 
most recent HF gene therapy trials that tested the efficacy of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic 
reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV), 
while proving the safety of this therapy in advanced HF patients, demonstrated no benefit 
over control treatment [13,14]. The biopsy results from patients in the treatment group 
indicated minimal uptake of the injected vectors in the human heart with less than 0.1% of 
estimated cardiomyocyte coverage based on the vector genome found in the myocardium 
[14,15]. Although potential efficacy was suggested in other HF gene therapy trials, they 
have not yet reached Phase III. Table 1 summarises these studies [13,14,16–21] and more 
details are available in our recent review [22]. In this review, we discuss key components 
of gene therapy for HF treatment, identify the barriers that prevent efficient cardiac 
uptake of therapeutic genes, and discuss approaches for overcoming these barriers (Central 
Illustration, Figure 1)
Gene Delivery Vectors for HF
Gene delivery requires a vehicle or carrier, called a vector, to introduce therapeutic genes 
into target cells. Each vector has specific features that can be characterised by differences 
in transduction efficiency, packaging capacity for a specific genome size, immunogenicity, 
genomic integration, timing, and duration of transgene expression [23]. In general, viral 
vectors are more efficient in transducing cells compared to non-viral vectors [24,25]. 
However, there are certain advantages of non-viral vectors over viral vectors, such as larger 
gene size transport capabilities and ease of production [24].
Non-Viral Vectors
Naked nucleic acids including DNA, mRNA, microRNA (miR), and siRNA lack scaffolds 
for protection against degradation and are minimally effective in independently transfecting

cells in vivo. Plasmids, which consist of small circular, double-stranded DNA found in 
bacteria and other microorganisms, can carry various sizes of genes and are considered 
the simplest form of gene delivery vector. Advances in bioengineering techniques for mass 
production of plasmids and overall lowered immunogenicity offer an advantage, but their 
low transfection efficiency limits their value as an independent vector for in vivo use 
[26]. Recently, synthetic modified mRNA has received attention by showing efficacy in 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines [27]. Unlike DNA-based therapies, modified 
mRNA avoids the risk of genomic integration and induces potent protein expression within 
a short-term period (1–2 weeks) with low immunogenicity [28]. Cardiomyocyte transduction 
has been reported by replacing all uridine residues with pseudouridine, even in the absence 
of lipid-based carriers [29], although direct injection into the heart is still required for in 
vivo applications due to lack of cardiotropism. Nevertheless, this is a promising new vector 
for HF gene therapy in which only short-term gene expression is required. A recent Phase 
IIa clinical trial investigated the efficacy of intramyocardial injection of VEGF-A modified 
mRNA [30]. Though terminated early due to slow recruitment, the investigators reported 
that preliminary data supported safety and suggested potential efficacy [29].
Täubel and colleagues reported interesting findings from their first-in-human Phase Ib 
trial targeting miR-132 with non-viral specific antisense oligonucleotide, CDR132L [19]. 
This miR-132 inhibitor has been reported to both decrease and reverse HF severity in 
pre-clinical large animal models [31,32]. In a total of 28 eligible patients (20 randomised 
to CDR132L [four dose groups ranging 0.32 mg/kg–10 mg/kg] and eight randomised to 
placebo saline), dose-dependent decrease in circulating miR-132 and a favourable safety 
profile were reported, which support progression to a subsequent study.
In another Phase I clinical trial completed in 2020 (INXN-4001, ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT03409627), 12 patients with advanced HF supported with left ventricular assist 
devices were treated with triple effector plasmid gene therapy that included the three 
well-established regulatory genes in the progression of HF: SDF-1α, VEGF165, and 
S100A1 [22,23]. With the combination of the three plasmids, the therapy sought to 
promote myocardial regeneration, angiogenesis, and functional improvement all together. 
A press release from Precigen, Inc. reported safety and feasibility of the therapy with no 
reports of adverse events 6 months after delivery (https://www.prnewswire.com/, accessed 
Jan. 2023). With additional gene targets such as delivery of synthetic mRNAs encoding 
insulin-like-growth factor-1 [34] and acid ceramidase [35] showing efficacy in murine 
studies [36], non-viral vector gene therapy possesses strong momentum spurred on by 
the enthusiasm following the recent success in mRNA-based therapy for COVID-19 
vaccination. Meanwhile, cardiac specificity, targeting efficiency, and durability of treatment 
remain areas that need improvement for treating HF using these vectors.
Viral Vectors
The commonly used viral vectors for cardiac gene therapy are adenovirus and AAV. 
Initial gene therapy studies mainly used adenovirus, however AAV became more popular, 
especially for HF treatment owing to its long-term expression, vital for chronic disease 
management. Other viral vector platforms include RNA viruses, such as lentivirus and

Sendai virus. Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus consisting of an icosahedral capsid and 
a linear, double-stranded DNA genome with more than 60 serotypes known to exist so 
far. Adenoviral vectors have been modified to reduce immunogenicity. For example, the 
third-generation adenoviral vector, known as the “gutless” vector, is cleared of all viral 
coding sequences except for inverted terminal repeat sequences and packaging signals. 
This vector has improved gene transfer efficacy with its larger packaging capacity, longer 
transgene expression, and lower immunogenicity [37,38]. Although adenoviral vectors can 
efficiently transduce cardiomyocytes, their broad tropism and lack of selectivity to the heart 
must be considered when used as a vector. AAVs are parvoviruses that are non-pathogenic 
to humans. AAVs have a non-enveloped capsid with a single-stranded DNA genome of ~4.7 
kB. Transgene expression generally takes 2–4 weeks when genes are packaged as single-
stranded DNA. By using self-complementary DNA, transgene expression occurs faster (as 
early as 4 days) by eliminating the time needed for second-strand DNA synthesis [39]. 
However, it is important to note this reduces the packaging capacity of genes and is therefore 
only applicable to small genes. Several features make the AAV vector a beneficial option for 
HF gene therapy, including effective cardiac transduction in some serotypes such as AAV1, 
6, 8 and 9 [40], low immunogenicity, and persistent transgene expression.
Lentivirus is a type of retrovirus containing single-stranded RNA, which can carry genes and 
randomly integrate them into the host genome. Its key features include the ability to produce 
long-term transgene expression by host genomic integration, a packaging capacity of ~9 kB, 
early transgene expression (peak ~6 days), and mild immune response [25]. Concerns of 
oncogenesis and limited specificity for cardiac cells confine its in vivo use. However, as 
represented in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for blood cancers, its application in 
ex vivo gene therapy is emerging [41].
Approaches to Improve Vectors for HF Gene Therapy
Despite different features of a variety of vector options, none of the currently available 
vectors are ideal for HF gene therapy (Table 2). Non-viral vectors have low gene 
transduction efficiencies with low cardiac specificity and are prone to degradation in 
the bloodstream. In addition, associated transgene expression is transient and genes that 
require long-term expression will not have persistent effects. In contrast, the higher 
gene transduction efficiency of viral vectors comes with the cost of vector-related 
immune responses and limited packaging capacities. Although some AAV serotypes show 
cardiotropism, specificity after systemic administration is not high enough to achieve 
sufficient cardiac gene transduction in advanced mammals. We discuss immune response 
and delivery later in this review and throughout this section, with a focus on approaches for 
vector modification.
Nanocarriers such as lipids, polymers, peptides, and nanoparticles can be used to 
protect nucleic acids and vectors from degradation. To improve cardiac specificity, 
these are combined with cardiomyocyte-targeting peptide conjugation [42], surface 
modification of carriers [43], or direct coating with cardiotropic molecules [44]. While 
significant improvements in gene transduction in rodents have been reported using these 
methods as evaluated by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or

immunohistochemistry, their efficacy in larger animals remains to be demonstrated. More 
potent molecules that can efficiently and specifically target the heart will significantly 
enhance the capabilities of non-viral gene therapy. It is important that these carriers do not 
induce immune responses.
Capsid modification is an approach that is actively used to modify viral vectors. By 
changing the viral surface, modification can reduce the immune response to the vector 
while also enhancing cardiotropism. Novel AAV vectors have been produced using directed 
evolution and capsid shuffling approaches. For instance, Weinmann et al. [45] discovered 
an AAV9 mutant, called AAVMYO, with superior efficiency and specificity for transgene 
delivery in muscle tissue including skeletal muscle, heart, and diaphragm. Asokan et al. 
[46] generated a chimeric AAV (AAV2i8) with high muscle tropism and reduced liver 
tropism. This vector also had an altered antigenic profile compared to the base AAV 
serotypes with lower antibody prevalence in humans [47]. AAV2i8 encoding constitutively 
active inhibitor-1 gene [47,48] is now under evaluation in a multicentre, open-label, non-
randomised Phase I trial in 12 patients with NYHA Class III HF (NCT04179643) [33].
Immunity in HF Gene Therapy
The human innate and adaptive immune responses to delivered vectors and transgene 
products present a considerable obstacle to HF gene therapy. Though the use of viral vectors 
capitalises upon the evolutionarily adapted viral fitness to transduce human cells, the human 
immune response to protect host cells against foreign invaders has also complexly evolved to 
counteract these effects [49]. The immune response can be divided into the humoral immune 
response, which is antigen-specific and induces long-lasting protection against pathogens 
through antibodies secreted by plasma cells in response to B cell activation, and the cellular 
immune response, which involves the destruction of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells.
The humoral immune response is a barrier to universally applying gene therapy to all patient 
populations. Those who have been exposed to naturally existing viruses possess antibodies 
that can neutralise the vector administered for treatment. Although geographical variability 
exists [50], neutralising antibody prevalence for some AAV serotypes has been reported to 
be as high as 70%. Similarly, treatment with a specific vector can lead to the development 
of antibodies against it and preclude repeat treatment using the same vector. Antibodies can 
also develop against transgenes when the target genes are not expressed endogenously, and 
can diminish long-term therapeutic efficacy [51].
The cellular immune response is induced by antigen presentation of the infected cells toward 
either the viral capsid or the transgene. Cytotoxic T cells can attack and damage infected 
cells, which can cause severe inflammation and organ damage. Assays such as enzyme-
linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and flow cytometry-based assays can help determine 
the existence of T cell immunity [52]. Adenovirus is particularly potent in inducing 
the CD8+ T cell immune response and requires careful attention post-administration. 
Meanwhile, clinical trials of recombinant AAV gene therapies also reported T cell-mediated 
immune response resulting in liver injury [53,54]. This incidence is expected to be dose-
dependent and caps the maximal vector dose that can be given at once. Although no

clinical studies to date have reported T cell immune response in cardiac gene therapy, the 
SERCA-LVAD1 trial reported a positive ELISPOT in one of the patients who received 
AAV1.SERCA2a [14]. Interestingly, this patient presented with pre-existing neutralising 
antibodies against AAV1 prior to gene therapy.
Approaches to Overcome Immune Responses
To evade the neutralising effects of existing antibodies against viral vectors, patients in 
clinical trials are usually screened for antibody profiles and those with high antibody 
titres are excluded [13]. The in vitro cell-based neutralising antibody (NAb) assay is 
an efficient and cost-effective method to assess patient seroprevalence and titre levels 
for candidate selection [55]. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be 
employed complementarily to the NAb assay for rapid detection of the measurement of 
antibodies and antigens in patient serum [56]. The ELISPOT assay is unique to the NAb 
assay in that it detects cytokines induced by the activation of antigen-specific B and T cells 
in response to the viral vector or transgenes [57].
A straightforward approach in previous studies to overcome the humoral immune response 
was to increase the vector dose. Although administration of higher doses generally increased 
AAV transduction, associated activation of capsid-specific T cell immunity diminished the 
efficacy [58,59]. Another approach was to administer extra empty capsids to use them as a 
decoy and absorb neutralising antibodies [32]. Findings revealed that empty capsids restored 
the vector transduction in both high and low titresof neutralising antibodies against AAVs 
in a dose-dependent manner [60]. While this is a promising avenue in AAV delivery, the 
potential triggering of an anti-capsid T cell immune response remains a concern, especially 
with recent high-dose applications in clinical trials.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) share many commonalities with viruses with respect to 
biological, chemical, and physical properties, incorporation of biological materials, and 
involvement in the immune response [61]. With studies indicating that EVs possess the 
capability to carry AAVs, subsequent research investigated the use of EVs as a gene delivery 
effector for vector protection [62]. By avoiding interaction with neutralising antibodies, 
AAVs packaged in EVs can more efficiently transduce cells and can also potentially 
overcome the repeat-dosing limitation. However, EV packaging likely results in modified, or 
loss of, tropism that is offered by AAV capsids.
Removal of antibodies is another approach that has been proposed to overcome 
humoral immune responses. Plasmapheresis, a therapeutic plasma exchange extracorporeal 
technique, has shown great promise in clearing autoantibodies and anti-AAV antibodies 
from human plasma [63]. More recently, increased gene transduction by selective depletion 
of AAV antibodies using the same principle was demonstrated in an immunised rat study 
[64]. Studies into the use of IgG proteases in animal models and transplant patients have 
also shown potential to overcome the effect of antibodies [64–67]. These studies utilised 
imlifidase, an endopeptidase capable of degrading and cleaving IgG. AAV administration 
with imlifidase treatment in immunised mice and antibody-positive non-human primates

reduced plasma total IgG and anti-AAV antibodies, resulting in improved gene transduction 
[66,67].
The above approaches address the barrier of existing antibodies against AAVs; however, 
they remain limited in their abilities to combat patients’ innate immunity and T cell 
response. To overcome cellular immunogenicity, studies are exploring the use of steroid 
treatments, with common immunosuppressive treatments including rapamycin combined 
with corticosteroids, or rapamycin administered in conjunction with rituximab [68]. 
Rapamycin is crucial to include in combination treatments for its role as an inhibitor of 
the mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which mediates 
the T cell response [69]. Rituximab is also used for its ability to deplete T cell levels 
through targeted treatments [70,71]. Administration of these immune suppression drugs has 
been reported to be effective in reverting elevated liver enzymes in the recent clinical 
trials that reported side-effects [72]. ImmTOR is a unique application of rapamycin, 
which encapsulates rapamycin within nanoparticles. When ImmTOR nanoparticles were 
administered simultaneously at the time of repeat AAV gene delivery, inhibition of the innate 
and humoral immune responses to AAV have been observed with successful gene expression 
[71,73]. Our understanding of immune response to viral vector is improving, but there are 
limited data on cardiac gene therapy and more studies in both clinical and preclinical areas 
are necessary.
Cardiac Uptake and Biodistribution
It is important to consider key physiological and anatomical cardiovascular parameters 
shared between humans and model systems when modifying delivery and dose strategies to 
improve upon cardiac uptake [74]. Similarities in heart rate, heart weight, and body weight, 
between humans and animal models should be considered to further induce comparable 
cardiac transduction in face of barriers to achieve adequate and sustained cardiac uptake. 
The majority of gene delivery vectors lack cardiotropism. Even with AAV9, which is 
considered the most cardiotropic among the available gene delivery vectors, cardiac uptake 
is low in advanced species, with findings in large animals showing much lower viral 
genomes in the heart after intracoronary delivery [15]. Moreover, systemic injection results 
in high vector uptake in non-cardiac organs including the liver. Off-target distribution can be 
a concern for genes that can modify other organs’ function and immune response, such as 
liver and kidney injuries reported in recent clinical trials [73].
The most prominent barrier that prevents cardiac uptake with intravascular delivery 
is the endothelial barrier. Under normal conditions, endothelial cells form intercellular 
junctions that regulate the permeation of necessary molecules and limit leakage of other 
materials [75]. To overcome the endothelial barrier, permeability-increasing agents such as 
nitroglycerine [76], vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [77], and histamine [78] are 
used with vector administration. While the efficacy of these agents has been demonstrated 
in animal models, it remains unclear which agent is most effective and whether a change in 
permeability is dependent on vector size.

Delivery Modifications
To address low cardiac uptake and to improve cardiac specificity, a variety of gene delivery 
methods have been developed. Intramyocardial injection overcomes the endothelial barrier 
by directly delivering vectors into the myocardium. Due to the limited distribution, the 
vector retention is usually local at the injection site and transgene expression is scattered 
around a few millimeters radius of injection sites [79]. However, even with direct injection, 
excess vectors likely enter the venous or lymphatic drainage system and reach other 
organs [80], resulting in off-target vector distribution. This method additionally requires 
either open-chest surgery (epicardial) or special injection catheters, which are currently not 
commercially available (endocardial).
Intracoronary injection is another commonly used cardiac targeted gene delivery method 
in preclinical and clinical studies. While injecting the vectors along the blood circulation 
offers a more homogeneous vector distribution [81], the transduction efficacy is usually 
low due to the endothelial barrier. In addition to the above-described agents to increase 
vessel permeability, mechanical methods, such as balloon occlusion of the coronary artery 
and coronary sinus [82], pressure-controlled retrograde injection [83], and microbubble 
destruction [84] methods have been employed. The balloon occlusion approach likely 
improves cardiac vector uptake not only by modifying the endothelial permeability but also 
by extending the vector dwell time in the coronary circulation.
Molecular cardiac surgery with recirculating delivery developed by Bridges et al. delivers 
vectors while on cardiopulmonary support [85]. This allows isolation of systemic circulation 
from cardiac circulation and offers recirculation of vectors, which can minimise off-target 
distribution. This is likely an option for HF patients with planned on-pump surgery. 
More recently, vector delivery for donor hearts using a TransMedics Organ Care System 
was shown to be effective [86]. This approach can be used to reduce post-transplant 
complications or to improve donor heart longevity in end-stage HF patients.
The efficacy of the above methods has been tested in different vectors, such as non-viral, 
adenovirus, and AAV, with various doses, for example 1012 to 1014 viral genome/subject 
for AAV in different large animal models of ischaemic and non-ischaemic HF including 
pig, sheep, dog, and rabbit [87]. These inconsistencies in experimental protocols preclude 
direct comparison of efficacy to understand the most efficacious methods and key factors 
that regulate cardiac gene uptake. Additionally, the majority of studies were done using 
adenovirus or non-viral materials, and there is almost no data regarding the impact of 
delivery method on AAV cardiac uptake and off-target distribution. Recently, we reported 
that cardiac uptake of AAV9 was similar between intravenous and intracoronary deliveries 
in swine with few neutralising antibodies [88]. This result challenges the generally accepted 
concept of the first-pass effect, which underlies the rationale for cardiac-targeted delivery. 
Whether this holds for other vectors remains unknown, as well as whether there exists a 
threshold for the amount of antibody. Moreover, as discussed above, there is evidence that 
additional interventions such as balloon occlusions can increase cardiac gene uptake [82,89–
91], indicating the importance of mechanical factors in regulating cardiac vector uptake. 
Further investigations and studies are needed to identify the safest and most effective gene 
delivery method for HF gene therapy.

Conclusion
We reviewed current barriers in HF gene therapy and approaches to overcome these barriers 
with a focus on vectors, immune responses, and delivery methods (Summary, Table 3). 
Current technologies are not capable of transducing all cardiac cells in the myocardium, 
and gene expression is limited based on concerns around off-target effects and immune 
responses. Further improvements are necessary to understand the potential for clinical 
translation of HF gene therapy in the discussed areas, as well as in other areas such as 
promoters, genes, and monitoring of transgene expression.

Barriers in cardiac gene therapy.
A. Genes are delivered using vectors, but anatomical, immunological, and endothelial 
barriers prevent efficient cardiac uptake of therapeutic genes. B. Examples of approaches 
to overcome these barriers. Top: Vector modification by engineering the capsid (left) and 
coating (right). Middle: Immune modulation by plasmapheresis to remove antibodies (left) 
and drugs to suppress immunity (right). Bottom: Cardiac targeted delivery with balloon 
occlusion to modulate mechanical factors. Parts of some Figures were adapted from https://

Strength and limitations of viral and non-viral vectors.
Strength
Limitations
Viral Vectors
•
Efficient gene transduction
•
Long-term gene expression in vivo with some vectors
•
Tropism towards cardiomyocytes with some vectors
•
Transduction can occur in dividing and non-dividing cells with some vectors
•
Immunogenicity
•
Potential insertional mutagenesis
•
High cost of vector production
•
Limited carrying capacity
Non-Viral Vectors
•
Larger carrying capacity
•
Production is easier than viral vectors
•
Low immune response
•
Prone to degradation in the bloodstream
•
Low transduction efficiency
•
Often requires invasive delivery

Barriers in heart failure gene therapy.
Barriers to Cardiac Gene Therapy
Description
Solutions to Address Barriers
Examples of Solutions
Vector:
•
Degradation
•
Serotype selection
•
Titration
•
Size capacity
•
Specificity
•
Non-viral vectors prone to 
degradation and lack cardiotropism
•
Non-viral vectors and adenovirus 
show transient expression
•
Important to find balance between 
dose and potential toxicity
•
Optimisation of vector 
design
•
Vector protection
•
Capsid modification
•
Nanocarriers and EVs can protect nucleic 
acids and vectors from degradation
•
Vector surface modification, Cardiotropic 
peptide conjugation
•
Use of directed evolution and capsid 
shuffling approaches for AAV
Immunogenicity:
•
Neutralising antibodies 
against viral vectors
•
Immune response to 
transgene
•
Therapies should account for cellular 
and humoral immune responses for 
both vectors and transgenes
•
Development of neutralising 
antibodies against viral vectors with 
initial exposure precludes repeat 
treatment
•
Assays to screen for 
candidate selection
•
Immune modulation drugs
•
Antibody removal
•
Neutralising antibody, ELISA, ELISPOT 
assays
•
Use of excess empty capsids as a decoy
•
IgG Proteases, Plasmapheresis
•
Combination immunosuppressive steroid 
treatment, ImmTOR nanoparticles
Vector Delivery:
•
Anatomical challenge
•
Endothelial barrier
•
Off-target distribution
•
Anatomically protected location
•
Unintended off-target effects can 
cause deleterious phenotypic effects
•
Intravascular delivery has to overcome 
endothelial barrier
•
Use of targeted 
and minimally invasive 
delivery techniques
•
Use of permeability-
increasing agents
•
Cardiac targeted delivery: Direct 
intramyocardial, Intracoronary, Pericardial
•
Delivery coupled with balloon occlusions, 
nitroglycerine, VEGF-A, histamine, etc.
Abbreviations: AAV, adeno-associated virus; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoassay; ELISPOT, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot; EV, extracellular vesicles; VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor
