ABSTRACT
Background: It is common to find substantial Alzheimer disease (AD) lesions, i.e., neuritic
-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in the autopsied brains of elderly subjects with
normal cognition assessed shortly before death. We have termed this status asymptomatic AD
(ASYMAD). We assessed the morphologic substrate of ASYMAD compared to mild cognitive im-
pairment (MCI) in subjects from the Nun Study. In addition, possible correlations between linguis-
tic abilities in early life and the presence of AD pathology with and without clinical manifestations
in late life were considered.
Methods: Design-based stereology was used to measure the volumes of neuronal cell bodies,
nuclei, and nucleoli in the CA1 region of hippocampus (CA1). Four groups of subjects were com-
pared: ASYMAD (n  10), MCI (n  5), AD (n  10), and age-matched controls (n  13). Linguistic
ability assessed in early life was compared among all groups.
Results: A significant hypertrophy of the cell bodies (44.9%), nuclei (59.7%), and nucleoli
(80.2%) in the CA1 neurons was found in ASYMAD compared with MCI. Similar differences
were observed with controls. Furthermore, significant higher idea density scores in early life were
observed in controls and ASYMAD group compared to MCI and AD groups.
Conclusions: 1) Neuronal hypertrophy may constitute an early cellular response to Alzheimer dis-
ease (AD) pathology or reflect compensatory mechanisms that prevent cognitive impairment de-
spite substantial AD lesions; 2) higher idea density scores in early life are associated with intact
cognition in late life despite the presence of AD lesions. Neurology® 2009;73:665–673

A puzzling feature of the neurobiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the heterogeneity of
clinical outcomes in individuals with comparable degrees of pathologic lesions in the brain.
The systematic neuropathologic assessment of older adults, particularly participants in longitu-
dinal studies of aging, has revealed that many individuals with documented normal clinical
status shortly before death have substantial AD lesions, -amyloid neuritic plaques (NP) and
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), that can be as severe and have the same distribution as in
subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),1 and even in some cases of AD dementia.2,3 In
previous studies, this clinical-pathologic status has been reported under various names, such as
high pathology controls4 or preclinical AD.5 Since it is not possible to know a priori whether
these subjects would have remained clinically intact or eventually would have progressed to
MCI or dementia if they had lived longer, we have termed this status asymptomatic AD

(ASYMAD).6,7 The clinical-pathologic disso-
ciation that characterizes ASYMAD is sub-
stantiated when the AD lesions in these
subjects are assessed using standard neuro-
pathologic criteria, i.e., the Consortium to Es-
tablish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(CERAD) criteria for NP8 and Braak staging
system for NFT,9 and show comparable scores
to those present in MCI and in some cases of
AD dementia.10
In previous studies6,7 of ASYMAD in the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging
(BLSA), we found significant hypertrophy of
cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in neurons of
CA1-hippocampus (CA1), anterior cingulate
gyrus (ACG), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG),
and primary visual cortex (PVC). The neuro-
nal hypertrophy followed an anatomic pro-
gression starting from the more anterior
regions (CA1 and ACG) in ASYMAD to the
more posterior regions, i.e., PCG in MCI,
and then PVC in AD. This pattern of pro-
gression (CA1-hippocampus/cingulum/oc-
cipital cortex) of neuronal hypertrophy
matches the topographic sequence of AD pa-
thology as described by Braak & Braak de-
cades ago.9 We have proposed that the
hypertrophy of neurons in ASYMAD, as
compared to MCI, may reflect a compensa-
tory response to the AD pathology that pre-
vents cognitive decline and accounts for the
divergent clinical outcomes of these 2 groups
of subjects.
Our previous studies6,7 examined subjects
from the BLSA study,11 most of whom were
men (75%). The main objective of the
present study was to quantify the same mor-
phometric parameters that we examined in
the BLSA study, but in a different longitudi-
nal cohort. The Nun Study was ideally suited
to this end since all the enrolled subjects are
women, therefore complementing the pre-
dominance of men in the BLSA study, and all
participants had well-documented, rigorous
clinical and neuropathologic evaluations.
Moreover, many of the participants have
available data on linguistic abilities in early
life. Based on clinical and autopsy assess-
ments, we defined, similarly as in BLSA stud-
ies, 4 groups of subjects: 1) age-matched
controls, 2) ASYMAD, 3) MCI, and 4) AD,
as defined below. The present study focused
on the CA1 region of the hippocampus,12,13 a
region which is particularly vulnerable to AD
pathogenesis.
METHODS Clinical and cognitive data. Participants in
the Nun Study are Catholic sisters, who are members of the
School Sisters of Notre Dame congregation living in the United
States.14 All sisters born before 1917 were asked to participate in
the study. Informed written consent was obtained from 678 sis-
ters and they were all enrolled in the study between 1991 and
1993. In the present study, a subset of participants in the Nun
Study was selected for the morphometric analyses. Investigations
of the Nun Study were approved by the University of Kentucky’s
Institutional Review Board.
Selection criteria. We selected the subjects from the Nun
Study database according to the following criteria: 1) cognitive
assessment performed less than 12 months before death; 2) avail-
ability of CA1-hippocampus tissue sections; 3) exclusion of cases
with cerebrovascular diseases, primary or secondary brain tu-
mors, or neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, such as
Lewy body diseases or tauopathies. Based on these selection cri-
teria, identical to our previous BLSA studies, we identified and
examined the brains of 38 subjects.
Clinical evaluations. The tools used to diagnose intact cogni-
tive status, MCI, and dementia have been described in previous
Nun Study publications.15 Briefly, participants classified as cog-
nitively intact had scores within normal limits on 4 cognitive
tests in the neuropsychological battery of CERAD.16,17 They also
had intact global cognitive ability as measured by the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE)18 and were intact regarding
activities of daily living (ADL).19 Sisters with MCI had intact
global cognitive function and ADL, but had at least 1 specific
area of cognition impaired (usually memory or naming). De-
mentia patients demonstrated functional decline, with impair-
ments in memory and at least one other area of cognitive
function, and impaired ADL. For a more detailed description of
the criteria used, see Snowdon et al.14
We had available scores on linguistic abilities in 14 subjects,
i.e., idea density and grammatic complexity, obtained from es-
says that the participants wrote as they entered the convent in
their late teens or early 20s. A complete and detailed description
of these language variables is reported in Snowdon et al.14 Briefly,
idea density was defined as the average number of ideas expressed
per 10 words. Ideas corresponded to elementary propositions,
typically a verb, adjective, or prepositional phrase. The gram-
matic complexity was computed using the Developmental Level
metric originally developed by Rosenberg and Abbeduto.20
Neuropathologic material and methods. We examined a
total of 38 postmortem brains. Brains were removed and exam-
ined macroscopically after fixation in 10% buffered formalde-
hyde for at least 2 weeks. For diagnostic purposes, tissue blocks
were dissected from middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle
temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, occipital cortex (Brod-
mann areas 17–18), entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala,
thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Tissue blocks were pro-
cessed and embedded in paraffin, cut at 10 m, and stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and Hirano-silver method21 for diag-
nostic purposes. The severity of NP was assigned a semiquan-
titative and age-adjusted score (0, A, B, or C) according to

CERAD8 and the NFT stage was scored (0–VI) according to
Braak9 (table 1).
Definition of study groups. Based on the clinical and neu-
ropathologic criteria described above, we distinguished 4 differ-
ent groups: 1) controls (n  13): these age-matched control
subjects had normal cognition and no significant AD pathology
at autopsy (CERAD 0, Braak 0–II); 2) ASYMAD (n  10):
subjects with normal cognition and AD pathology (CERAD
B–C, Braak III–V); 3) MCI (n  5): subjects with a diagnosis of
MCI and AD pathology (CERAD B–C, Braak III–V); 4) AD
(n  10): patients with dementia and definite AD pathology at
autopsy (CERAD B–C, Braak IV–VI).
Demographic, cognitive, and neuropathologic data for each
subject are summarized in tables 1 and 2.
Stereologic methods. Serial coronal sections (50 m thick)
from the right CA1-hippocampus region at the level of the lat-
eral geniculate nucleus were obtained. From these sections, we
selected randomly 2 sections 500 m apart and stained them
with cresyl violet. For the stereologic analysis, we examined the 2
sections of CA1 with a light microscope interfaced with a Stereo-
Investigator system.22 Using a 100, NA 1.30, oil Uplan FL
/0.17 objective, the images were captured with a video camera
Hitachi HV-C20 3CCD. With the StereoInvestigator Optical
Disector software, we outlined the contour of CA1 and selected
sampling sites with a grid size  250  250 m. The CA1
region was defined according to Lorente De No’.23 The disector
height was 35 m with a 2-m guard zone. Then, using the
Isotropic Nucleator probe,24 we placed 8 rays through the center
of the nucleolus and marked the intersections of these rays with
the edge of the nucleolus, nuclear membrane, and cellular mem-
brane. Based on these measurements, the software calculates the
volumes of the nucleolus, nucleus, and cell body. If a ray ex-
tended into a dendrite, the ray was cut at the base of the dendrite
(figures 1 and 2). We measured between 201 and 238 neurons
per each CA1 region. Neurons were measured if their cell bodies
were inside the sampling site or if their nuclear membrane inter-
sected or touched the inclusion (green) line. Neurons were ex-
cluded if their nuclear membrane intersected or touched the
exclusion (red) line. The neurons measured were selected with
optical disectors so that the selection was number-weighted, not
size-weighted. All stereologic assessments were performed
blinded to the clinical and neuropathologic classifications.
APOE genotyping. Because of the relevance of APOE poly-
morphism as a risk factor of AD and for the severity of pathology
in AD, each subject was genotyped for the APOE gene. APOE
genotyping was conducted on DNA isolated from buccal swabs
(archival) or from brain tissues as previously described.25
Statistical analyses. Analysis of variance across groups was
performed for continuous variables: mean age at death, means of
final MMSE scores, and brain weight. Fisher exact method was
used for the categorical variables: CERAD NP score, Braak-NFT
staging score, and educational levels.
An exact Fisher test was used to probe the APOE allelic fre-
quencies across groups. For the statistical analyses of APOE fre-
quencies, we compared 3 groups: 1) subjects with cognitive
deficits and AD pathology (MCIAD; n  15); 2) subjects with
preserved cognition and AD pathology (ASYMAD; n  10);
and 3) age-matched controls (n  13).
For the analysis of language abilities (i.e., idea density and
grammatic complexity), we clustered the subjects into 2 main
groups: 1) subjects with cognitive deficits and AD pathology
(MCIAD; n  6); and 2) subjects without cognitive deficits

with and without AD pathology (age-matched controls 
ASYMAD; n  8). A t test was performed between these 2
groups for each variable.
RESULTS We found a marked hypertrophy of all 3
compartments of CA1 neurons in ASYMAD com-
pared with MCI: cell bodies (44.9%; p  0.05),
nuclei, (59.7%; p  0.01), and nucleoli (80.2%;
p  0.01). A similar change was present in the CA1
neurons of ASYMAD compared to controls: cell
bodies (30.9%; p  0.05), nuclei (36.4%; p 
0.01), and nucleoli (41.9%; p  0.05). Moreover,
we measured a significant atrophy of cell bodies, nu-
clei, and nucleoli in AD compared with controls. All
morphometric data are presented in figure 3. Mean
age at death, educational level attained, and intervals
between last cognitive evaluation and death were not
significantly different among the groups. Although
the average brain weight was lower in the AD group
compared to all others, no significant differences
among the groups were found. The CERAD NP
scores showed a significant difference only between
controls and all other groups (p  0.0001), and did
not show differences among all other pairs of com-
pared groups: ASYMAD vs MCI, ASYMAD vs AD,
and MCI vs AD groups. Braak-NFT scores showed
differences in controls compared to all other groups
(p  0.001), between ASYMAD vs AD (p  0.001),
and between MCI vs AD (p  0.001). Notably,
no significant difference was present between the
ASYMAD vs MCI group for Braak-NFT scores.
The mean score of final MMSE was different
when comparing controls vs MCI (p  0.05) and vs
AD (p  0.0001), ASYMAD vs AD (p  0.0001),
and MCI vs AD (p  0.0001). There were no signif-
icant differences in the final MMSE scores of
ASYMAD vs controls or ASYMAD vs MCI (table 2).
As described in Methods, for the APOE genotypes,
we compared ASYMAD subjects vs the combined
MCI and AD groups. APOE4 frequency was higher
in MCIAD groups (33%) compared to ASYMAD
(5%) (p  0.001). In contrast, APOE2 frequency
was higher in the ASYMAD subjects (30%) com-
pared to the MCIAD subjects (3.3%) (p  0.012)
(table 2).
The language ability analysis showed a significant
higher idea density score in the subjects without cog-
nitive deficits (2 ASYMAD and 6 controls) (score 
6.9) compared to subjects with cognitive deficits (1
MCI and 5 AD) (score  5.0). By contrast, the mean
grammatic complexity score did not show any differ-
ence between these 2 groups (figure 4).
DISCUSSION The major finding of the present study
is the significant hypertrophy of cell bodies, nuclei, and
nucleoli in CA1 neurons of ASYMAD subjects com-
pared with the MCI and age-matched controls group.
These results are similar to those observed in previous
studies of ASYMAD subjects from the BLSA cohort.
These data support the idea that this neuronal hypertro-
phy is a general phenomenon, not restricted to partici-
pants in a single longitudinal study, and is present in
both sexes. In addition, our observations indicate a
functional and morphologic plasticity and heterogene-
ity in response to the AD lesions in the human brain
even in the ninth or 10th decade of life. In fact, whereas
some subjects develop cognitive impairment (MCI
or dementia), others remain relatively unscathed
(ASYMAD) in presence of significant and comparable
AD pathology. This neuronal hypertrophy might be re-
lated to or even underlie the capacity of the ASYMAD
subjects to maintain the cognition and effective daily

living activities preserved, despite the presence of sub-
stantial AD lesions.
This observation of diverging clinical outcomes in
subjects with comparable AD lesions is consistent
with the brain reserve hypothesis already described
by various investigators.26
From a functional perspective, the synapses are
the critical structures in neurons and their circuits.
The enlargement of the neuronal cell body is proba-
bly a surrogate for the expansion of the dendritic ar-
bor and postsynaptic structures. This concept is
supported by our observation of hypertrophy of cor-
tical neurons in the APPsw/PS1 E9 transgenic
mouse27 and the observation of an increased number
of synaptic contacts in the same animal model.28 An-
other possibility is that the hypertrophic neurons are
extending or growing new axonal terminals along
with their presynaptic structures. It is plausible that
the larger neuronal somata in ASYMAD reflect adap-
tive changes of neurons and their circuits to compen-
sate for the damage inflicted by neurotoxic effects of
A and tau. It is then attractive to postulate that in
ASYMAD, the enlargement of nuclei and nucleoli is
the expression of enhanced DNA and RNA syntheses
necessary to sustain the repair of injured neurons,
and their processes and synapses. This latter no-
tion is further supported by 2 recent studies. One
study showed that in the frontal cortex of patients
with MCI, there is a paradoxical upregulation of
presynaptic boutons.29 The other study reported
that in the frontal cortex of old-older normal
controls with AD pathology, equivalent to our
ASYMAD group, synaptophysin, a presynaptic
marker, is enhanced.30
An alternative explanation, based on functional neu-
roimaging studies,31,32 could be that in ASYMAD,
some neurons and circuits are irreversibly damaged
by AD pathology, and different and compensatory
circuits become operative based on different stages of
disease. Consequently, the circuitry of the cerebral

cortex may remain functional despite the presence of
AD pathology.
At the cellular level, there is a positive linear cor-
relation among the size of the nucleolus, nucleus, and
cell body in neurons.33 The nucleolar volume appears
as a sensitive indicator of the transcriptional and
metabolic activities. Our analyses show that the nu-
cleolus was the compartment with the highest per-
cent of increase in volume. Since the nucleolus is a
key organelle for the synthesis, assembly, and pro-
duction of ribosomes, the nucleolar hypertrophy may
reflect enhanced transcriptional and biosynthetic ac-
tivities. Although the molecular mechanisms under-
lying the observed hypertrophy of neuronal cell
bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in ASYMAD are beyond
the scope of this study, we can formulate some possi-
ble explanations drawing from previous studies in
animals. Studies in transgenic models have shown
that the cell body sizes of neurons, their nuclei and
nucleoli are plastic structures and could be influ-
enced by overexpression of the APP gene. Further-
more, neuronal size can also be influenced by
exposure to sexual hormones,34 regeneration after ax-
onotomy,35 or brain trauma,36 as well as by learning
and enriched environmental experiences.37 One of
the main determinants of the cell size is the cell
growth, which is modulated by growth factors, i.e.,
BDNF,38 and by genes and products of the TOR
pathway.39 These genes and proteins appear as attrac-
tive targets for future studies of ASYMAD.
In terms of the analysis of linguistic ability in this
study, it is important to remark that the linguistic
scores were available in only 93 out of 678 sisters
enrolled in the Nun Study. This explains the avail-

ability of these data in only 14 subjects in this study.
To circumvent this limitation, we opted to compare
the linguistic scores between subjects with or without
cognitive deficits. Despite the small number of sub-
jects available, a significant association between
higher idea density scores and the absence of cogni-
tive deficits was observed. Although it would have
been ideal to examine the linguistic scores in a group
composed solely of ASYMAD subjects, this was not
possible since only 2 of the ASYMAD subjects had
linguistic scores available. Independently of these
limitations, it remains a fascinating observation that
an intellectual ability measured in the early 20s can
predict the likelihood of remaining cognitively nor-
mal 5 or 6 decades later, even in the presence of sub-
stantial AD pathology. We are aware of the very
small size of our samples and the need for a follow-up
investigation including larger number of subjects.
It is particularly important to keep in mind that the
4 groups analyzed in this study were clustered based on
their clinical states and the severity of NP and NFT.
These 2 elements represent insoluble protein aggregates

in the brain. We cannot rule out the possibility that
although ASYMAD and MCI have comparable
NP and NFT scores, they may have different levels
of soluble toxin proteins, i.e., A oligomers.
The observation of the 30% frequency of the
APOE2 allele in ASYMAD, significantly higher than
the MCI and AD group, was unexpected and surpris-
ing for its magnitude. Previous studies have shown
that the APOE2 allele protects against the develop-
ment of AD.40 Although the difference in the
frequency of APOE2 in ASYMAD was highly signif-
icant (p  0.012) compared to the combined
MCIAD groups, the interpretation of this differ-
ence should be tempered by the small sample size.
Nevertheless, the difference suggests that the APOE2
allele has the potential to protect the brain from the
neurotoxic effects of A and tau, and may be associated
with the neuronal hypertrophy. A final caveat is
whether individuals with APOE2 alleles have inherently
larger neurons. To answer this question, an analysis of a
very large sample of old and young control subjects be-
yond the scope of this study would be required.
