Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Early cognitive decline may manifest in subtle differences in speech.
METHODS: We examined 238 cognitively unimpaired adults from the Framingham
Heart Study (32–75 years) who completed amyloid and tau PET imaging. Speech pat-
terns during delayed recall of a story memory task were quantified via five speech
markers, and their associations with global amyloid status and regional tau signal were
examined.
RESULTS: Total utterance time, number of between-utterance pauses, speech rate,
and percentage of unique words significantly correlated with delayed recall score
although the shared variance was low (2%–15%). Delayed recall score was not signifi-
cantly different between β-amyoid-positive (Aβ+) and -negative (Aβ−) groups and was
not associated with regional tau signal. However, longer and more between-utterance
pauses, and slower speech rate were associated with increased tau signal across medial
temporal and early neocortical regions.
DISCUSSION: Subtle speech changes during memory recall may reflect cognitive
impairment associated with early Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

BACKGROUND
Speech is central to the diagnosis and assessment of neurodegener-
ative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),1 given that verbal
responses are required to describe one’s medical history and to com-
plete the majority of gold-standard neuropsychological tests. The
effective use of speech requires intact functioning within and across
cognitive domains. Thus, early cognitive decline may manifest through
subtle changes in speech patterns. Investigating speech during neu-
ropsychological testing provides the ideal opportunity to identify new
speech markers of early cognitive decline as the process does not inter-
fere with standardized testing procedures. Speech markers can also be
combined with traditional neuropsychological test scores (e.g., delayed
recall memory scores) to determine if speech markers provide unique
information. Promising speech markers can then be validated against
established disease biomarkers to determine if speech markers offer a
sensitive and scalable approach for early detection.2,3
In the context of AD, there are likely subtle speech changes even in
the initial disease phase, although this has not yet been directly exam-
ined. Word finding difficulties and repeating questions are amongst
the most common subjective cognitive concerns in older adults, and
cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with abnormal levels of β-
amyloid (i.e., Aβ+) are approximately 1.2 times more likely to endorse
these speech-related problems than those with normal levels of Aβ (i.e.,
Aβ−).4 This suggests that speech changes reflect development of AD
pathology even in the absence of overt cognitive impairment. Although
many aspects of speech can be quantified, individuals with mild cog-
nitive impairment and AD dementia exhibit longer and more frequent
pauses in speech than CU older adults,5–14 and between-utterance
pauses in particular may reflect memory retrieval and semantic knowl-
edge deficits that are the earliest AD cognitive symptoms.7 Changes
in patterns that occur within utterances, such as increased repetition
(which would reduce the percentage of unique words) and reduced
speech rate, may also reflect memory ability and, thus, be especially
relevant to AD.
The pathological hallmarks of AD, Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary
tau tangles, are present long before the onset of clinical impairment.
Neuropathological studies have shown varying degrees of Aβ and tau
accumulation in individuals age 40 and above.15 However, most amy-
loid and tau PET imaging studies have focused on older adults given
that the risk of AD dramatically increases in older age and sporadic
AD generally occurs after age 65.16 Aβ plaque deposition tends to be
globally distributed throughout association cortices, whereas regional
tau tangle pathology tends to be restricted to the medial temporal lobe
with some involvement of inferior temporal (IT) and inferior parietal
(IP) cortices17–22 in older CU cohorts. Additionally, older Aβ+ CU indi-
viduals with elevated tau PET signal show subtle deficits in memory,
language, and executive function.19,21,23 However, it remains unknown
whether similar associations with cognition would be detected in mid-
dle age. It is possible that speech markers may provide increased ability
to detect cognitive changes earlier in the lifespan as compared with
traditional neuropsychological testing scores.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Speech is central to the diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and speech changes have been
reported in the mild cognitive impairment and demen-
tia stages. However, no studies have examined whether
speech patterns relate to biomarkers of AD in the stages
preceding cognitive impairment.
2. Interpretation: Longer and more between-utterance
pauses as well as slower speech rate during delayed
memory recall were associated with increased early tau
signal in medial temporal lobe and early neocortical
regions. Between-utterance pause time and speech rate
most strongly reflect processing speed, whereas number
of between-utterance pauses reflects memory encoding
and working memory, although the amount of variance
explained by neuropsychological testing was weak.
3. Future directions: Our results show that subtle differ-
ences in speech during delayed memory recall may be
an indicator of early AD pathology. Future studies should
explorehowspeechcanbeusedasascalableapproachfor
early detection of AD.
The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) offers a unique opportunity to
examine how speech patterns relate to Aβ and tau across adulthood.
A subset of FHS participants completed neuroimaging and neuropsy-
chological assessments were recorded, enabling the development of
new speech markers specifically aimed at identifying early cognitive
decline and AD pathology. Leveraging FHS data, the aims of this study
were to determine whether speech patterns during delayed recall of a
story memory task relate to (1) traditional memory scores, (2) Aβ sta-
tus, and/or (3) regional tau PET burden. Our overarching hypothesis is
that speech markers will capture additional information beyond tradi-
tional neuropsychological scores and that speech markers will relate to
Aβ and tau PET burden.

METHODS
2.1
Participants
The FHS is a community-based longitudinal observational study that
began in 1948 and consists of several cohorts, including the Original,
Offspring, and Third Generation Cohorts.24 Digital audio recordings of
all FHS neuropsychological assessments began in 2005,25 and a subset
of Offspring and Third Generation participants underwent structural
MRI, amyloid PET, and tau PET imaging (Figure 1A). Of the neuroimag-
ing subset, excluded participants included 51 participants who did not
undergo tau PET imaging, 1 participant who did not have a T1 scan pre-
cluding definition of regions of interest, 3 participants who did not have

a neuropsychological assessment within 1 year of the tau PET scan, 3
participants who completed neuropsychological testing but not Logi-
cal Memory (LM) Delayed Recall within 1 year of the tau PET scan, and
1 participant with high tau PET signal greater than 3 standard devia-
tions (SDs) above all other participants (Figure S1). The remaining 237
CU participants were included in our analyses. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent, and protocols were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at Boston University Medical Center and
Massachusetts General Hospital.
2.2
Speech preprocessing
Audio recordings were stored in .wav format. The LM Delayed Recall
portions of the neuropsychological assessment closest in time to the
tau PET scans were manually and orthographically transcribed with
the EUDICO Linguistic Annotator (ELAN) tool26 using the Code for
the Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT) format system.27 Utter-
ance definitions followed the Language Development Project Utter-
ance Boundaries protocol (https://ldp-uchicago.github.io/docs/guides/
transcription/sect_4.html).28–31 Utterances were defined as a word
or sequence of words that are preceded and/or followed by at least
one of the following boundaries: a pause longer than 2 s, a complete
sentence, a change in conversational turn, self-interrupted speech to
express an entirely different thought, unfinished thoughts that trail off
without completing the sentence of phrase, or a change in intonation
pattern that typically manifests as a rising (e.g., questions) or falling
(e.g., declaratives/statements) pitch (Figure 2).
Following standard LM administration procedures, the test admin-
istrator was allowed to prompt for additional information at the end of

the participant’s recall; because responses following the prompt were
included in the LM delayed recall score, speech following the prompt
was also included when quantifying speech markers. Only participant
speech was included when quantifying speech markers; in other words,
test administrator speech was not included.
2.3
Definition and reliability of speech markers
The transcribed data were analyzed with the Computerized Language
Analysis (CLAN) software32 and the following speech markers were
automatically quantified: (1) total utterance time (i.e., total amount
of time the participant spent speaking excluding between-utterance
pauses); (2) total between-utterance pause time (i.e., sum of the indi-
vidual lengths of between-utterance pauses, which can be less than
2 s if utterances were defined by non-time-based boundaries such as
complete sentences; these values were log-transformed due to high
skewness); (3) number of between-utterance pauses; (4) speech rate
(i.e., number words per minute); and (5) percentage of unique words
[i.e., type token ratio: number unique words divided by number total
words without consideration of lemmas and lexemes (Supplementary
results)].
Speech marker reliability was established by having a second coder
transcribe 20% (n = 47) of the recordings. Comparison of word-by-
word transcriptions showed a mean agreement rate of 86% (SD = 9%);
mean interrater agreement of utterance (and thus between-utterance
pause identification) was 88% (SD = 9%). Intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients (ICCs) calculated with a two-way mixed, agreement design and
the single-measure output demonstrated high interrater reliabilities
for all five speech markers [utterance time ICC = 0.963; between-
utterance pause time ICC = 0.958; number of between-utterance
pauses ICC = 0.919; speech rate ICC = 0.952; percentage of unique
words ICC = 0.978].
2.4
Amyloid and tau PET acquisition and
processing
PET scanning was completed at Massachusetts General Hospital33–38
using a Siemens ECAT HR+ (n = 199) or a GE Discovery MI (n = 47)
camera. For amyloid PET [11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)], dynamic
data were collected for 60 min post-injection. PiB data were recon-
structed into 39 frames. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) images were
created using Logan graphical analysis with frames corresponding to
40–60 min post-injection and cerebellum cortex as the reference.39
For tau PET [18F-Flortaucipir (FTP)], data were acquired 75 to 105 min
post-injection. FTP data were reconstructed into 5-min frames and
frame data were summed. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs)
were calculated using FreeSurfer-defined cerebellum cortex.
Structural T1-weighted data were acquired using a Philips Achieva
3T scanner at MGH (TR = 6800 ms, TE = 3.1 ms, flip angle = 9 degrees,
voxel size = 0.98 × 0.98 × 1.2 mm). The T1-weighted scan closest in
time to the PET scans were processed using FreeSurfer version 7.1.
Regional PiB and FTP values were extracted based on FreeSurfer-
defined regions of interest (ROIs) in each subject’s native space.
T1-weighted scans were co-registered to the PET images, and the
resulting co-registration parameters were applied to the aparc + aseg
FreeSurfer labels.17 Mean PiB DVRs and FTP SUVRs were extracted
from each aparc + aseg region.
2.5
Amyloid and tau PET processing
For amyloid PET, global composite values were calculated using
the volume-weighted average across frontal, anterior cingulate cor-
tex/posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal
regions.40 Gaussian mixture modeling, applied to the global composite
values, confirmed two distributions and a DVR cutoff corresponding to

90% probability of belonging to the Aβ+ cluster was used to determine
amyloid positivity (Figure S2). For tau PET, volume-weighted SUVRs
were calculated for five target regions of interest (bilateral entorhi-
nal, amygdala, IT, IP, and precuneus) and putamen, a control region with
known off-target binding.41
2.6
Statistical models
First, we examined correlations and partial correlations controlling for
age, sex, education, and amyloid status between LM Delayed Recall
and all five speech markers. Second, linear regression models were
used with demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, education) and amy-
loid status predicting each of the following: LM Delayed Recall, the five
speech markers, and regional tau burden. Third, linear regression mod-
els with regional tau, amyloid status, age, sex, and education predicting
LM Delayed Recall and the five speech markers were conducted. This
analysis was also conducted within the Aβ−group only. Finally, we
probed the speech markers that showed significant associations with
tau to better understand the cognitive mechanisms. Given that many
neuropsychological test scores are correlated with each other (Figure
S3), we used the following ridge regression procedure bootstrapped
10,000 times using all neuropsychological test scores to predict each
tau-related speech marker: (1) for each bootstrapping iteration, split
the data into train (70%) and test (30%) sets, (2) find the optimal lambda
(shrinkage parameter) value using the training set, (3) use the trained
model to predict the speech marker value using all cognitive scores
in the test set, and (4) evaluate R2 on the test set. The nine partici-
pants with missing amyloid status were removed from all analyses that
included amyloid status as a covariate or dependent variable.

RESULTS
3.1
Participants
Participants ranged from 32 to 75 years old and Aβ+ individuals
were significantly older than Aβ−individuals (Table 1). Aβ+ and Aβ−
groups showed a small but non-significant difference in LM delayed
recall score, and Aβ groups performed similarly on most other neu-
ropsychological tests (Table S1). Aβ+ individuals (8% of sample) had
significantly higher tau SUVRs than Aβ−individuals in entorhinal, IT, IP,
and precuneus, and older age was significantly associated with higher
tau SUVRs in IT, IP, and putamen and lower tau SUVR in entorhinal
(Figure 1B; Table 2).
3.2
Speech markers and LM delayed recall
Longer utterance time (p < 0.001), more between-utterance pauses
(p = 0.047), faster speech rate (p = 0.007), and a lower percentage
of unique words (p = 0.002) were significantly correlated with bet-
ter LM Delayed Recall (Figure 3). However, the proportion of variance
explained was low to moderate, (R2 = 0 to 0.15). The five speech mark-
ers were all significantly correlated with each other with one exception
(i.e., total utterance time and speech rate) and the proportion of vari-
ance ranged widely from 0.01 to 0.45. Associations among speech
markers and LM Delayed Recall were generally similar after controlling
for demographic variables and amyloid status (Figure S4).
3.3
Speech markers and amyloid status
Aβ−and Aβ+ groups did not significantly differ on any of the five
speech markers or in LM Delayed Recall (Table 3). Demographic
influences on the five speech markers and LM Delayed Recall were
generally absent.
3.4
Speech markers and regional tau
LM Delayed Recall was not significantly associated with regional tau
SUVR in any of the regions of interest (Figure 4; Table S2A). However,
longer between-utterance pause time was significantly associated with
higher tau SUVR in entorhinal and IP; more between-utterance pauses
were associated with higher tau SUVR in entorhinal and IP; and slower
speech rate was associated with higher tau SUVR in entorhinal, amyg-
dala, and precuneus (Figure 4; Table S2A). No speech markers were
associated with tau SUVR in the putamen control region. Results were
generally consistent when additionally controlling for LM Delayed
Recall (Table S2B), not controlling for any covariates (Figure S5; Table
S3), when including the outlier Aβ+ individual with very high tau PET
signal (Figure S6; Table S4), and when examining Aβ−individuals only
(Figure S7; Table S5).
3.5
Associations between tau-related speech
markers and other neuropsychological tests
We next focused on the three speech markers that showed associ-
ations with tau signal and explored potential cognitive mechanisms
underlying each marker. Ridge regression weights indicated better
Trails A,42 Coding,43 and Similarities43 scores were the strongest pre-
dictors of shorter between-utterance pause time; better Digit Span
Backward43 and LM Immediate and Delayed recall44 scores were
the strongest predictors of more between-utterance pauses; and bet-
ter Trails A,42 Coding,43 Similarities,43 Digit Span Forward,43 and LM
Delayed Recall44 scores were the strongest predictors of faster speech
rate (Figure 5A). However, median R2 values were low (Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION
We found that speech patterns during delayed recall on a story mem-
ory task relates to early tau PET signal across adulthood. More specif-
ically, longer between-utterance pause time, more between-utterance

pauses, and slower speech rate were associated with higher tau bur-
den even when controlling for delayed recall score and when examining
Aβ−individuals only. Conversely, delayed recall performance was not
associated with tau burden in any examined region, suggesting that
speech markers show greater sensitivity to detecting subtle cogni-
tive changes associated with early tau accumulation. Exploration of
how individual speech markers relate to comprehensive neuropsy-
chological testing suggests that between-utterance pause time and
speech rate most strongly reflect processing speed, whereas number
of between-utterance pauses reflects memory encoding and working
memory, although the amount of variance explained by neuropsycho-
logical testing was weak. Taken together, these results suggest that
speech patterns during memory recall provide novel information not
captured by traditional neuropsychological testing that may be useful
for understanding early tau signal.
Greater tau burden was associated with longer between-utterance
pause time, more between-utterance pauses, and slower speech
rate, and associations were similar across multiple regions in the
medial temporal lobe and neocortex. The strongest associations with
between-utterance pause time and number were in entorhinal and IP
cortices. This is consistent with hypotheses of AD progression within
the memory system as both of these regions support representa-
tions of retrieved content in the context of speech-related memory

expression.45 Importantly, an association between speech markers and
tau signal was not observed in the putamen, a region known to have off-
target binding to iron.46 Thus, the associations we found with regions
known to show elevations in early AD17,47 likely do not solely reflect
off-target binding. Further, although the FHS cohort is younger than
other unimpaired cohorts, we found significant increases in regional
tau values in Aβ+ individuals compared to Aβ−, providing additional
support that the subtle variation in tau PET signal was biologically
meaningful.
Our results relating speech markers to regional tau PET signal are
consistent with work from Cho and colleagues, who showed associ-
ations between CSF p-tau with speech and language features from a
picture description task in amnestic AD and logopenic primary pro-
gressive aphasia patients.2 Interestingly, although the speech context
(picture description vs. memory recall) and impairment level (dementia
vs. CU) differs from our study, their finding of higher pause rate related
to increased CSF p-tau mirrors our finding of increased between-
utterance pause time and number with higher tau PET signal. In the
context of a Phase II anti-tau antibody clinical trial, speech patterns
during a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview has been shown to
display similar or greater levels of change over 18 months as compared
to common clinical trial endpoints such as CDR Sum of Boxes and Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE).48 Together, these studies highlight
the potential for speech markers to be used for the detection and mon-
itoring of tau. Our findings add to this literature by emphasizing that
the association between tau and speech markers emerges very early
during the disease course in Aβ−CU individuals and that speech may
be useful for monitoring disease progression.
It may be especially fruitful to examine speech during delayed recall
of a story memory task. In addition to delayed recall being used for
the diagnosis of cognitive impairment and for screening and cognitive
endpoints in AD clinical trials,49,50 delayed recall allows for continu-
ous speech in a circumscribed manner. Furthermore, a single delayed
recall score does not capture the multiple cognitive domains required
to produce that score (e.g., LM delayed recall scores reflect memory
as well as verbal comprehension and general ability51), but different
speech markers reflecting different underlying cognitive domains that
are susceptible to early decline can be quantified. Interestingly, the uni-
variate associations between speech markers and LM Delayed Recall
were weak despite being derived from the same verbal output. The
strongest association with LM Delayed Recall was with utterance time,
which is likely driven by more structured and richer utterances that

require more time to form and speak, and are more likely to contain
the key phrases used for scoring. Because pauses are not considered in
the scoring protocol, it is intuitive that between-utterance pauses were
the speech markers most weakly associated with LM Delayed Recall.
Utterance time and between-utterance pause time were weakly corre-
lated, indicating that individuals do not pause for longer simply because
they are speaking for a longer. Faster speech rate was also related to
better LM Delayed Recall and this may reflect increased confidence
in recall.52 Finally, percentage of unique words provides information
about the nature of spoken language, and the association between
fewer unique words and better LM Delayed Recall was likely driven
by increased repetition of function words with a grammatical purpose
(e.g., she, the). The five speech markers explained only 0%–15% of
the LM Delayed Recall score when examined individually, highlighting
that speech markers capture unique information that is distinct from
delayed recall scores.
In addition to assessing univariate associations between delayed
recall score and speech, we also examined multivariate associations
between comprehensive neuropsychological scores and the three
speech markers related to elevated tau (i.e., between-utterance pause
time, number of between-utterance pauses, speech rate). Although this
analysis showed that the combination of individual neuropsychologi-
cal tests were not strong predictors of speech markers, examination
of the best predictors provided insight into potential underlying cog-
nitive mechanisms of speech. Specifically, 2/3 strongest predictors for
between-utterance pause time were processing speed measures (Trails
A and Coding), although these tests do not solely measure processing
speed; the strongest predictors of the number of between-utterance
pauses were measures of working memory and encoding (Digit Span
Backward, LM Immediate Recall); and three of five strongest predic-
tors of speech rate were measures of processing speed and attention
(Trails A, Coding, Digit Span Forward). Understanding the precise cog-
nitive processes that lead to specific speech patterns will be critical for
emphasizing the relevance of speech in AD.
Our general lack of demographic influences on speech during mem-
ory recall differs from previous literature. We only found significant
age effects with older adults producing a lower percentage of unique
words, but several other studies have found that healthy older adults
speak slower,53,54 in longer sentences,55 and with more pauses53 com-
pared to young adults (although speech rate follows an inverted-U
pattern with the fastest rate around age 4556,57). We also only found
sex differences in utterance time with longer speech in women, mir-
roring a finding of more words produced during a picture description
task.58 However, other studies have found no difference in talkative-
ness between sexes.59,60 Although we found no effect of education on
any of our five speech markers, one study has shown increased speech
production with higher education.58 Critically, speech was elicited with
a picture description task in most of these other studies and context is
known to affect speech production.53 In fact, the same speech marker
may reflect different processes depending on the context. For example,
it has been suggested that pauses when describing a series of pic-
tures reflects lexical and semantic impairment, whereas pauses when
recalling an event that occurred earlier in the day reflects memory
impairment.7 Although replication is needed, our data suggest that the

additional demand of memory recall largely eliminates demographic
influences on speech.
Our study has several limitations. First, the extent to which slightly
elevated early tau PET signal reflects actual neurofibrillary tangles
rather than other age-related changes remains unclear.41,61 Second,
there is no consensus on spoken utterance boundary definitions and
quantification of speech markers is affected by utterance definitions.
Our transcribing process did not incorporate instrumental quantifica-
tion of acoustic changes,62 which may improve utterance detection.
However, our a priori utterance definition protocol was highly reli-
able and can thus be reproduced in future studies. Future work that
explores different approaches to defining utterances is warranted to
establish whether sensitivity for detecting initial AD changes using
speech data can be improved. Third, we limited our examination to only
five speech markers extracted from delayed recall. These markers were
correlated with each other (Figure 3) and there are likely additional
uniquemarkersthatarevaluabletoinvestigate.Futureresearchshould
explore additional speech, language, and acoustic markers and probe
how these markers change depending on the context of speech espe-
cially because speech during memory recall may not fully represent
naturalistic speech.
Our main finding that speech patterns during delayed recall relate
to early tau signal across adulthood is promising given the potential
scalability and ease of collecting and processing speech data, although
complexities such as multiple speakers and recording quality must
be considered. Between-utterance pause time, number of between-
utterance pauses, and speech rate during delayed recall are especially
insightful for understanding early tau signal across medial temporal
lobe and early cortical regions, and may reflect early subtle deficits
across different cognitive processes. Our findings lay the foundation
for developing more scalable approaches to capturing speech markers
that relate to early tau signal.
