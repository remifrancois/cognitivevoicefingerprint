The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: evidence of psychometric adequacy 
ELLEN GROBER1, KATJA OCEPEK-WELIKSON2 & JEANNE A. TERESI3 
Abstract 
These analyses examine the psychometric properties of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding 
Test with Immediate Recall (FCSRT-IR). FCSRT-IR is a measure of memory under conditions that 
control attention and cognitive processing in order to obtain an assessment of memory unconfounded 
by normal age-related changes in cognition. FCSRT-IR performance has been associated with preclini-
cal and early dementia in several longitudinal epidemiological studies. Factor and item response theory 
analyses were applied to FCSRT-IR data from patients at a geriatric primary care center who had inde-
pendently established clinical diagnoses. The results provide supporting evidence for the psychometric 
adequacy of the FCSR-IR in terms of reliability, essential (sufficient) unidimensionality, information 
across the continuum of memory disability/ability, and classification accuracy. The psychometric 
adequacy of the FCSRT-IR adds further validity to its use as a case finding strategy for dementia.

The FCSRT-IR 
267 
Introduction 
 
Memory testing is critical to identifying dementia because current criteria for the diagno-
sis of any dementia, irrespective of subtype, require that memory impairment be present 
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994; McKhann, Drachman, Folstein, et al, 1984). Im-
paired memory is one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most 
common form of late-life dementia. The availability of biomarkers of AD, including struc-
tural and molecular neuroimaging changes and cerebrospinal fluid, and an interest in measur-
ing memory functioning in mild cognitive impairment (MCI: Petersen, 2004), the transitional 
state between normal cognition and AD, have led to the development of revised criteria for 
AD (Dubois et al., 2007). These criteria are “centered on a clinical core of early and signifi-
cant episodic memory impairment” defined by controlled learning procedures modeled on 
those that have been developed in the Einstein Aging Study (EAS) over the past 20 years 
(Buschke, 1984; Buschke, Sliwinski, Kuslansky, & Lipton, 1995; Grober & Buschke, 1987; 
Grober et al, 1988; Grober, Lipton, Hall, & Crystal, 2000; Grober et al., 2008b; Lipton et al., 
2003). By controlling the conditions of learning, a measure of memory is obtained that is not 
confounded by normal age-related changes in cognition.  
Controlled learning begins with a study phase in which the patients identify words or pic-
tures (grapes, vest) in response to category cues (fruit, clothing) that are used in the test 
phase to prompt recall of items not retrieved by free recall. Controlled learning induces 
specific semantic processing for effective encoding of the to-be remembered items and it 
also provides for maximum cued recall because the same cues used to study the items ini-
tially are used in the test phase to retrieve items that were not retrieved by free recall. Testing 
memory using controlled learning conditions was posited to distinguish the genuine deficits 
in encoding and storage that characterize AD from the memory deficits associated with nor-
mal aging that are secondary to impaired attention, inefficient information processing, or 
ineffective retrieval operations (Grober & Buschke, 1987). Retrieval deficits that occur in 
many healthy elderly individuals are remediated by controlled learning procedures (Buschke 
et al., 1995; Grober, Merling, Heimlich, & Lipton, 1997). In patients with dementia, these 
procedures have very modest benefits. As a consequence, controlled learning procedures 
should increase differences produced by normal aging and dementia, thereby improving 
discriminative validity. Because memory is the earliest manifestation of AD and other causes 
of acquired memory impairment in the elderly are rare (Cummings & Benson, 1992), we 
reasoned that the identification of impaired memory under controlled learning conditions 
should be highly predictive of prevalent and incident AD (Grober et al, 1988; Grober et al., 
2008a; Grober, Lipton, Hall, & Crystal, 2000). 
The 16-item version of controlled learning is called the Free and Cued Selective Remind-
ing Test with Immediate Recall (FCSR-IR) (Grober & Buschke, 1987). It has been used in 
several other longitudinal aging studies in the North America and Europe to identify pre-
clinical and early dementia (Grober et al., 2008a; Lindenberger & Reischies, 1999; Petersen, 
Smith, Ivnik, Kokmen, & Tangalos, 1994; Petersen et al., 1995; Tuokko, Kristjansson, & 
Miller, 1995), and is used to determine inclusion and trigger clinical evaluations in the Alz-
heimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Instrumentation Protocol (Ferris et al., 2006). Most 
recently, FCSRT-IR performance distinguished patients with mild cognitive impairment who 
converted to AD from MCI nonconverters at levels that led the authors to define prodromal 
AD or the amnestic syndrome of the medial temporal lobe by FCSRT-IR performance

(Sarazin et al., 2007). Further validation of FCSRT-IR performance as an indicator of early 
AD comes from correlations with abnormalities in structural and functional imaging and 
with neurofibrillary lesions in parahippocampal regions that are the earliest targets of AD 
pathology (Grober et al., 1999; Habert et al., 2009; Lekeu et al., 2003; Zimmerman et al., 
2008).  
The purpose of these analyses were to examine: a) the internal consistency of the three 
test forms of FCSRT-IR, each consisting of 16 unique category-items pairs (fruit-grapes, 
bird-owl), b) the dimensionality of the FCSRT-IR using exploratory and confirmatory factor 
analysis, c) the information provided by the items and test, using item response theory, and 
d) the concurrent criterion validity by deriving receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves separately for each FCSRT-IR form, and then for the combined forms. IRT-based 
methods have been used previously in the evaluation of cognitive tests (Crane, Gibbons, 
Jolley, & van Belle, 2006; Jones, 2006; Morales, Flowers, Gutiérrez, Kleinman, & Teresi, 
2006; Mungas & Reed, 2000; Orlando-Edelen, Thissen, Teresi, Kleinman, & Ocepek-
Welikson, 2006; Teresi et al., 1995; Teresi, Kleinman, & Ocepek-Welikson, 2000; Teresi, 
Kleinman, Ocepek-Welikson et al., 2000). Although the FCSRT-IR is a widely used memory 
test, it has never been analyzed with respect to IRT.  
 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Subjects 
 
The subjects who provided FCSRT-IR data analyzed here were patients from the Geriat-
ric Ambulatory Practice (GAP), an urban academic primary care practice staffed by geriatri-
cians at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. Following procedures ap-
proved by the local institutional review board, patients were contacted by phone to determine 
eligibility and interest. Participants were 65 years or older; described themselves as White, 
not of Hispanic Origin, Black, not of Hispanic Origin, or Hispanic; provided the name of a 
family member or friend who had known them for at least 5 years; and had adequate vision 
and hearing to complete the neuropsychological tests. In addition, participants were required 
to score ≥ 18 on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE: Folstein et al, 1975), the most widely 
used screening test for cognitive impairment. We adopted a score of 18 or higher for two 
reasons: we wanted to capture all cases of mild dementia which often are missed in primary 
care (Callahan et al, 1995); and African American patients who score in the range of 18 to 23 
on the MMSE are frequently misclassified as demented (false positives) when they are not 
independently diagnosed as having a clinical dementia (Bohnstedt et al, 1994). Patients with 
scores lower than 18 are likely to have a more advanced dementia and would not need to 
undergo dementia screening. Two illiterate patients with lower scores were included because 
several errors they made were on language-related items. Participants completed a compre-
hensive battery of neuropsychological tests and informants were interviewed by phone. 
Presence or absence of dementia was established by consensus of an expert panel using 
DSM IV criteria independent of FCSRT-IR scores to avoid diagnostic circularity. The meth-
ods are described elsewhere (Grober & Buschke, 1987). The sensitivity and specificity of the 
different test forms in correctly classifying patients were compared to each other using a 
previously established FCSRT-IR cut score (Grober et al., 2000).

Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics for the patients who provided the 
FCSRT-IR data by form. As shown, 210 subjects were tested with Form A, 189 with Form B 
and 182 with Form C. The distribution of gender and race did not differ as a function of form 
nor did age, education, or MMSE scores. Among the same subjects, 50 (24.6%), 52 (28.1%) 
and 51 (28.3%) met DSM-IV criteria for dementia at baseline and 20 (13.6%), 16 (9.9%) and 
14 (9.0%) were diagnosed with incident dementia at the end of approximately 2 ½ years of 
follow-up when tested by Form A, Form B and Form C respectively. These differences by 
form were not statistically different.  
 
 
Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test with Immediate Recall (FCSRT-IR) 
 
The test begins with a study phase in which subjects were asked to examine a card contain-
ing line drawings of easily recognized objects (e.g., grapes) for an item that goes with a unique 
category cue (e.g., fruit). The 16 items to be learned were presented four at a time on a card, one 
picture in each quadrant. The subject was asked to search each card and point to and name aloud 
each item (e.g., grapes) after its cue (fruit) was aurally presented. After all four items were iden-
tified correctly, the card was removed, and immediate cued recall of just those four items was 
tested by presenting the cues again. The subject was reminded of any item he or she failed to 
retrieve by presenting the cue and the item together (e.g., the vehicle was a train).  
Once immediate recall for a group of four items was completed, the next set of items was 
presented for study. The study phase was followed by the test phase that consisted of three 
recall trials, each preceded by 20 seconds of subjects counting backward to prevent recall 
from short-term memory. Each recall trial consisted of two parts. First, each subject had up to 
two minutes to freely recall as many items as possible. Next, aurally presented category cues 
were provided for items not retrieved by free recall. If subjects failed to retrieve the item with 
the category cue, they were reminded by presenting the cue and the item together. The sum 
of free and cued recall is total recall. The current analyses focused on free recall.

There were forms of the FCSRT-IR (A,B,& C) each containing 16 simple line drawings 
of basic level items (e.g., vest, chimney) that belong to different semantic categories (article 
of clothing, part of a building). The particular items were selected from category norms 
(Battig & Montague, 1969) because they were unlikely responses when persons were asked 
to generate the name of an item from the semantic category to which the item belonged, yet 
the item was still familiar enough to be named readily. This was necessary to avoid correct 
responses due to guessing when the category cues were presented during the test phases to 
prompt recall (Grober, Gitlin, Bang, & Buschke, 1992). 
For this analysis, the items were created by summing across the three trials: if a subject 
recalled an item spontaneously in all three trials, the item score was three; two if recalled on 
two trials, one if recalled on one trial, or zero for no recall of that item on any trial. A sum 
score was produced as well as an IRT-based ability score (theta). A high score is indicative 
of higher memory ability. 
 
 
Methods of analyses 
 
The following analyses were conducted using the two parameter graded (for polytomous, 
ordered response category) item response models (Hambleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 
1991; Lord & Novick, 1968; Lord, 1980; Samejima &, 1969). First steps in the analyses 
include examination of model assumptions (such as unidimensionality) and model fit.  
“Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves: ROC curves were generated to visual 
differences in sensitivity and specificity across a range of cut-scores. The diagnostic accu-
racy of tests can by compared by examining the area under the ROC curve (AUC).” 
 
 
Tests of model assumptions: exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses 
 
Exploratory factor analyses (EFA), using the method of principal components were com-
pleted, followed by a test of scree. Eigenvalues and explained percent of variance for con-
secutive factors were evaluated to provide supporting evidence to confirm (or refute) the 
essential unidimensionality of the studied constructs. Because the FCSRT-IR test was as-
sumed to be essentially unidimensional, and the second factor was assumed to be only a 
nuisance factor, the confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) compared only the one factor solu-
tions to the two factor solutions to test whether the two factor solutions improved the model 
fit. EFA and CFA were conducted using the weighted least squares mean variance 
(WLSMV) estimator (weighted least square parameter estimates with standard errors and 
mean and variance adjusted chi-square test statistics that used a full weight matrix) in 
MPLUS (Multhen & Multhen, 2004).  
 
 
Item response theory model: polytomous response model  
 
In this model, ordered responses, x=k and k=1,2,...m, are assumed. The discrimination 
parameter or slope can be defined as ai, and difficulty parameters for response k as bik. 


---

The FCSRT-IR 
271 
P(x=k) = P*(k) - P*(k+1) = 1 / [1 + exp[-Dai(θ-bik-1)] - 1 / [1 + exp[-Dai(θ-bik)], where 
P*(k) is the item characteristic curve describing the probability that a response is in category 
k or higher, for each value of θ (Samejima, 1969; Thissen, 1991, 2001). The model assumes 
an average discrimination across response categories. 
Methods of estimation and software: Marginal maximum likelihood methods of parame-
ter estimation applying the EM algorithm (Bock & Aitken, 1981), available in MULTILOG 
(Thissen, 1991, 2001), were used to fit polytomous item response models. MULTILOG 
results were used to calculate a standardized residual measure of goodness-of-fit which is 
defined as the difference between the observed and expected frequency divided by the 
square root of the expected frequency for each response pattern associated with a particular 
level of theta (ability estimate). The standardized residual is distributed approximately nor-
mally with mean of 0 and σ2 of 1.  
Information function: The information function for score x is defined as the square of the 
ratio of the slope of the regression of x on θ to the standard error of x for fixed θ (Lord & 
Novick, 1968). The standard error of theta can be expressed as: Se(θ) = 1 / √I(θ). An item 
provides more information when the slope is steeper, the standard error is lower and when b 
(difficulty parameter) is close to the theta being evaluated.  
 
 
Results 
 
Test of model assumptions 
 
Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA) 
 
The eigenvalues for the first factors ranged from 6.34 (Form C) to 5.50 (Form A), which 
was roughly four times that of the second eigenvalues (ranging from 1.10 to 1.34). The first 
factor accounted for between 34% and 40% of the total explained variance. These results 
provide evidence of essential unidimensionality for all three Forms (see Figure 1).  
 
 
Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) 
 
The results of the CFA for the unidimensional model yielded non-significant χ2's for the 
Form C indicating the best model fit for the construct (χ2=58.1,d.f.=58, p=0.47). Although 
the χ2 model fit statistics were significant for Forms A and B (Form A: χ2=76.7, d.f.=58, 
p=0.05; Form B: χ2=81.8, d.f.=54, p=0.01), other fit statistics showed an acceptable fit for 
the unidimensional models, with little improvement evidenced for the two-factor models. For 
example, test of the two-factor models improved the root mean square residual index of fit 
by 0.01 from 0.04 to 0.03 for Form A and from 0.05 to 0.04 for Form B. The Comparative 
Fit Index (CFI) ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 across forms for the one factor solution, and from 
0.97 to 1.00 for the two factor solution. The standardized factor loadings ranged from 0.45 to 
0.65 for Form A, from 0.40 to 0.72 for Form B and from 0.40 to 0.70 for Form C (see Table 
2).

IRT-model fit and item parameter estimates 
 
Examination of standardized residuals (not shown) showed that all items fit the model for 
all forms: (z < 0.01 to 0.78) for form A; (z < 0.01 to 0.67) for form B; and (z < 0.01 to 1.03) 
for Form C. Shown in Table 3 are the parameter estimates from IRT. Parameters are sorted 
from the easiest item to the most difficult. The items optimally discriminate at a very wide 
range of theta/ability spectrum from ability level -3.45 to 2.63 for Form A; -3.67 to 2.96 for 
Form B; and -2.57 to 3.03 for Form C. The discrimination parameters were adequate, rang-
ing from 0.88 to 1.51, 0.75 to 1.85 and 0.75 to 1.86 for Forms A, B and C, respectively; the 
standard errors ranged from 0.18 to 0.25 for Form A, 0.19 to 0.28 for Form B and 0.19 to 
0.31 for Form C. The range for the difficulty parameter standard errors was from 0.15 to 
0.76 for Form A, 0.12 to 0.96 for Form B, and 0.13 to 0.90 for Form C. 
 
 
IRT item and test information functions 
 
The information functions were examined in order to determine item and total test dis-
crimination ability at different levels of latent (memory) ability. Individual item information 
functions were examined, and are presented in Figure 2. The highest information of all the

items was on Form C and peaked at 1.06 for item FR9 – Crown at theta level -0.6 and 0.88 
for item FR 1 – Bear at theta level -0.8. The next highest information was 0.99 on Form B 
and peaked at 0.99 for item FR1 – Spider at theta level 0.0 and 0.75 for item FR8 – Rolling 
pin at theta level -0.6 to -0.4. The highest item information on Form A was 0.68 at theta =  
-0.6 for item FR3 – Owl and 0.64 at theta 0.0 for item FR12 - Rattle. The following items 
provided the least information: items FR14 – Pipe, FR15 – Wreath and FR16 – Basket on 
Form B and item FR15 – Thread on Form C; these items never reached the level of 0.2 at 
any point along the theta continuum. Items on Form C provide peak information along the 
largest spread of thetas/ability levels.  
The test information functions (Figure 3) show that the test covered the full range of lev-
els of memory ability/theta, discriminating better in the middle range and slightly below the 
mean. The peak values for the information functions were 7.8, 7.9 and 9.7 for Form A, Form 
B and Form C respectively. 
 
 
Classical test theory and IRT reliability analyses  
 
For all forms, the overall Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was good: 0.85, 0.86 
and 0.88. Corrected item-total correlations were moderate for all the items, ranging from 
0.37 to 0.55 for Form A; 0.34 to 0.60 for Form B; 0.35 to 0.65 for Form C.

The FCSRT-IR 
277 
IRT analysis allows computation of test reliability estimates over the entire spectrum of 
the theta/cognitive ability continuum. The results show high reliability at all levels, for all 
three forms, with the highest value of 0.91 in the theta range from -0.8 to 0.2 for Form C, in 
the high 0.80’s over most of the theta distribution for all forms, and in high 0.70’s at the high 
ability end (2.8 – 3.0) of the theta distributions. The marginal reliabilities for the forms were: 
0.86, 0.87 and 0.89 for A, B, and C respectively. 
 
 
Examination of the distributions 
 
The distributional properties for the sum and theta scores were examined for the three 
forms and are summarized in Table 4. Typically the empirical distributions for these vari-
ables are normal or close to normal, but either negatively or positively skewed. This was the 
case for the current data set. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, used to test for distribu-
tional normality, were usually significant but relatively small. Examination of normal and 
detrended normal plots showed that the distributions of the original sum scores were ap-
proximately normal although negatively skewed for all three forms; the negative skew was 
partially due to the very low performance of the diagnosed cases of dementia included in the 
sample.

Concurrent criterion validity 
 
ROC curves were derived separately for each FCSRT-IR form and then for the combined 
forms. The area under the curve (AUC) was similar for the three forms ranging from 0.89 
(95%CI: 0.84,0.94) for form A, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80,0.94) for form B, and 0.91 (95% CI: 
0.86,0.96) for form C. Using the previously established cut score of ≤24 to distinguish preva-
lent and incident cases of dementia from non-cases (Grober et al, 2000), the sensitivity and 
specificity of the three forms was similar: for form A, sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.82; 
for form B, sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.86; and for form C, sensitivity = 0.77, specific-
ity = 0.87. Figure 4 shows the ROC curve for all forms combined. AUC was 0.88 (95% CI: 
0.86, 0.92). Sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 and 0.85 respectively using the cut score of 
< 24. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
Overall, the results provide support for the psychometric soundness of the FCSRT-IR. 
First, the factor analyses indicate that the 16 unique category-item pairs in each of the three 
forms assess a single construct or dimension which we presume to be memory ability. This

The FCSRT-IR

evidence of essential (sufficient) unidimensionality is important because it provides support-
ing evidence for our approach to identifying preclinical and early AD. By testing memory 
under controlled learning conditions, genuine deficits in encoding and storage that character-
ize AD are distinguished from the memory deficits associated with normal aging that are 
secondary to impaired attention, inefficient information processing, or ineffective retrieval 
operations (Light, 1991). The finding that a unidimensional model was the best fit for the 
data suggests that memory ability alone determines performance on the FCSRT-IR. Second, 
high reliability was evidenced in the IRT analyses for all three forms over the entire spec-
trum of the memory ability continuum. The test information functions indicate that the 
FCSRT-IR is reasonably discriminating over a relatively large range of the memory ability 
continuum. We view this as an advantage because the test is used not just for identifying 
incident and prevalent dementia but also for quantifying memory functioning in elderly 
persons without dementia at cross-section and longitudinally (Grober, Lipton, Katz, & Sli-
winski, 1998; Ivnik, 1997). Furthermore, the test has been shown in other studies to have 
promise for use in clinical trials to quantify change in memory functioning in patients with 
mild cognitive impairment, the transitional state between normal cognition and Alzheimer’s 
disease (Ferris et al., 2006; Sarazin et al., 2007).  
Third, the FCSRT-IR was shown to have good concurrent criterion validity according to 
ROC curves derived separately for each FCSRT-IR form and then for the combined forms. 
The criterion was presence or absence of dementia at baseline or follow-up determined by 
expert consensus using DSM IV criteria independent of FCSRT-IR scores to avoid diagnos-
tic circularity. Using the previously determined cut score of 24 or less over three trials of 
free recall (max recall = 48), sensitivity and specificity of the three forms combined for 
incident and very mild dementia (CDR=0.05) were 0.75 and 0.85 respectively. Classification 
accuracy was adequate (AUCs ranged from 0.87 to 0.91 across forms). That it was not 
higher reflects the reduction in accuracy that occurs when a cut score developed in one sam-
ple is applied to a different sample. In addition, the current cohort consists of primary care 
patients with co-morbid medical conditions that can complicate classification rather than 
patients from a memory disorders clinic that constitute an enriched sample.  
Finally, the psychometric properties of the three forms of the FCSRT-IR were similar in-
cluding their factor structure, internal consistency, information functions, and accuracy of 
classification, although Form C performs slightly better, in terms of test information. Limita-
tions of the analyses include the fact that the statistical equivalence of the three forms could 
not be evaluated because the forms do not include common category-item pairs; however, 
summary statistics such as means, medians and interquartile ranges were similar, as were 
reliability and validity estimates. Overall, each form appears to be a reliable and valid meas-
ure of memory ability.  
The present results may also be limited by the relatively small, but adequate sample sizes 
(n=about 200 across forms). The factor analyses resulted in acceptable properties, although 
slight misfit was observed. It is likely that with larger sample sizes the accuracy of the esti-
mates from the IRT, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, which are sensitive to 
small sample sizes, will improve. Additionally, future work will involve examining possible 
differential item functioning of the measure with respect to education and racial/ethnic 
groups; relatively small sample sizes did not permit such analyses.
