Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Identification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for early intervention
and selection of clinical trials.
METHODS: We applied natural language processing techniques along with machine
learning methods to develop a method for automated prediction of progression to AD
within 6 years using speech. The study design was evaluated on the neuropsychological
test interviews of n = 166 participants from the Framingham Heart Study, comprising
90 progressive MCI and 76 stable MCI cases.
RESULTS: Our best models, which used features generated from speech data, as well as
age, sex, and education level, achieved an accuracy of 78.5% and a sensitivity of 81.1%
to predict MCI-to-AD progression within 6 years.
DISCUSSION: The proposed method offers a fully automated procedure, providing
an opportunity to develop an inexpensive, broadly accessible, and easy-to-administer
screening tool for MCI-to-AD progression prediction, facilitating development of
remote assessment.

BACKGROUND
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and
has a long prodromal phase, during which subtle cognitive changes
occur. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage between normal cog-
nition and AD. Individuals with MCI are at higher risk of developing AD
with a 3% to 15% conversion rate of MCI to AD every year.1,2 There-
fore, accurately predicting the progression of MCI to AD can assist
physicians in making decisions regarding patient treatment, participa-
tion in cognitive rehabilitation programs, and selection for clinical trials
involving new drugs.3
Traditionally, AD pathology can be assessed using biomarkers such
as cerebrospinal fluid assays or neuroimaging techniques like positron
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).4–7
Several studies have explored these modalities to predict conversion
from MCI to dementia.8–12 Although these techniques provide useful
information, they are invasive and expensive, limiting their applicabil-
ity to well-resourced places and lacking the scalability and accessibility
needed for low- and middle-income countries.13 Furthermore, clinical
and pathological variabilityisobserved inAD using imaging techniques,
which can make accurate diagnosis and prognosis challenging.14
In contrast, a neuropsychological test (NPT), conducted through
an in-person interview, is currently the most accessible method for
assessing cognitive decline. The NPT, triggered by patient history
and in conjunction with a clinical examination, provides a compre-
hensive evaluation of cognitive function, including attention, mem-
ory, language, and visuospatial abilities. Researchers have explored
computer-based approaches to predict the progression from MCI to
AD using NPTs,15–18 primarily relying on hand-crafted features and
the cognitive scores extracted from the NPT by clinicians. However,
these approaches have not yet achieved full automation, limiting their
potential for more precise and efficient cognitive evaluations.
On the other hand, speech in the NPTs can be a strong predictor of
cognitive decline,19,20 and various artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted
diagnostic models using linguistic and acoustic features extracted
from the NPTs have been developed.21–23 The Framingham Heart
Study (FHS), which is the longest ongoing longitudinal, transgenera-
tional cohort study of chronic disease, has been digitally recording
the NPT interviews since 2005, and these voice recordings include
all major established cognitive tests, such as the Boston Naming Test
(BNT), Hooper Visual Organization Test, and Wechsler Memory Scale
(WMS).24 Several studies have used these recordings to develop diag-
nostic tools. For instance, a voice-based predictor was developed to
identify dementia using acoustic features.25 Xue et al. applied deep
learning methods to acoustic features from FHS voice recordings to
detect dementia and MCI.26 In our earlier work, we used natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) on the voice recordings to place each individual
across the dementia spectrum.27
NLP, particularly large language models (LLMs) popularized with the
introduction of ChatGPT, has emerged as a powerful tool in health
care, showing reliable performance in various tasks.28–30 By leveraging
LLMs, we open up new frontiers in AD research, leading to the devel-
opment of automated screening tools. Specifically, we consider the
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: After conducting a systematic review
of the literature, it is evident that no prior work has
tried to automate the processing of voice recordings of
neuropsychological tests using voice recognition to tran-
scribe them into text and subsequently applying natural
language processing (NLP) methods for analysis.
2. Interpretation: We have developed a novel approach to
automate the prediction of progression to Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) within a 6-year timeframe using speech
analysis. Our findings, derived from the neuropsycho-
logical test interviews conducted by the Framingham
Heart Study, demonstrate strong performance, achieving
an accuracy rate of 78.5% and a sensitivity of 81.1% in
predicting progression to AD within 6 years.
3. Future directions: This study highlights the immense
potential of integrating NLP techniques and speech data
in predicting the future progression to AD. The method
offers an opportunity to develop a cost-effective, widely
accessible remote screening tool for predicting the pro-
gression to AD.
classification problem of determining whether individuals with MCI
will progress to AD dementia within a 6-year window. Predicting con-
versions over a shorter period of time may be relatively easier, but has
limited clinical utility.31
Our automated pipeline uses audio recordings of the NPT to pre-
dict the likelihood of MCI subjects transitioning to AD within 6
years. We emphasize that our analysis only uses text automatically
transcribed from these recordings and it does not rely on any acous-
tic features. By leveraging transformer-based language models, we
aim to capture semantic nuances potentially missed by conventional
scoring, enriching the assessment with comprehensive text features.
This underscores our plan for developing a cost-effective, automated
tool that surpasses traditional methods in detecting AD progres-
sion. Conducting the NPT interview remotely, via a web interface
without clinician participation, can further minimize screening costs.
The pipeline incorporates diverse computational techniques, including
speech recognition, speech diarization, a transformer-based sentence
encoder, and logistic regression models.

METHODS
2.1
Study participants
A cohort of 166 subjects with cognitive complaints were consecutively
monitored by the FHS,32 consisting of 59 males and 107 females, with
a median age of 81 years (range: 63 to 97 years). It is noteworthy that

the demographic composition of our cohort is predominantly White,
reflecting the specific population from which the participants were
drawn. Each participant underwent an approximately 1 hour long NPT,
which was recorded and saved in the .wav format. The NPTs conducted
by the FHS include subtests assessing different cognitive domains, such
as memory, naming and language, visuoperceptual skills, abstract rea-
soning, and attention.33,34 Additional information such as education,
the type of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene alleles, and health risk factors
(suchasbloodglucose,diabetes,hypertension,etc.)werealsoavailable.
All the participants have a completed NPT for which an MCI diagnosis
was assigned. The cognitive status assignments such as AD diagnosis
and MCI for those showing signs of cognitive decline was reached by
consensus of at least one neurologist and one neuropsychologist, based
on neurology exams, FHS study and external medical records, and brain
imaging (the diagnostic procedure is outlined in Au et al.33 and Satiza-
bal et al.35). All participants have provided written informed consent
and study protocols and consent forms were approved by the Boston
University Medical Campus Institutional Review Board.
2.2
Data preparation
The cohort for this study was derived from a larger group of partic-
ipants whose NPTs were recorded by the FHS. This group consists
of individuals at various cognitive stages, including some who have
been diagnosed with MCI. Due to the increasing interest in AD and
related clinical trials, our analysis focused on predicting the progres-
sion from MCI to AD. We elected not to consider progression from
normal cognition to AD (or MCI) because the NPT has limited utility in
predicting future cognitive decline in individuals without any current
signs of cognitive deterioration. Therefore, we focused on MCI cases
and identified those who had either progressed to AD or remained MCI
within 6 years, as determined by a dementia review. Figure 1 shows
the number of patients transitioning to AD from MCI each year over
this period, representing the distribution of transitions, and indicating
that a larger number of patients tend to transition to AD earlier within
the 6-year timeframe. This observation suggests that the progression
from MCI to AD is more likely to occur in the initial years after the MCI
diagnosis.
In our previous work,27 we developed a tool to automatically tran-
scribe voice recordings. Each utterance was diarized (i.e., ascribed to
a speaker: participant or examiner) and each transcript was split into
the eight subtests comprising the FHS NPT. Some of these subtests
are part of larger batteries of cognitive assessments such as WMS,36
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS),37 and a revised form of
the WAIS (WAIS-R).38 In addition, there are several other tests that
are frequently administered independently, including the BNT,39 Ver-
bal fluency (FAS),40 and Clock Drawing Test (CDT).41 The other two
subtests are DEMO, which represents a part of the interview related
to demographic information, and OTHER, which includes parts that
are not categorized in the defined subtests. Using this developed
tool, the participants’ audio files were automatically transcribed, and
each sentence was automatically labeled based on the specific sub-
test to which it belonged, such as WMS, WAIS, WAIS-R, BNT, FAS,
CDT, DEMO, or OTHER. Figure 2 illustrates the automated pipeline
to extract such structured data from the raw voice recording. From
the prior study27 leveraging a similar population, the diarization task
demonstrated a performance with an exact F1 score of 70.2%, and the
subtest classification task achieved an accuracy of 96.2%.
2.3
Statistical analysis
The cohort consisted of 166 patients with MCI, 90 of whom progressed
to AD dementia (progressive MCI) and 76 remained MCI (stable MCI)
within the 6-year horizon. AD dementia included AD with stroke, AD
without stroke, and mixed dementia (vascular + AD). Over a 6-year
follow-up period, the participants with MCI had a mean (standard
deviation) time to AD of 2.7 (1.5) years. Table 1 presents the partici-
pant characteristics, including self-reported sex, education status, age
statistics, and six possible combinations of the three types of the APOE
gene (ε2/ε3/ε4) for both copies of the allele. The table suggests that
older women with lower education levels and those carrying one or
two copies of the APOE ε4 allele are more likely to progress to AD.
This finding aligns with previous studies that highlight age as the most
significant risk factor for AD.42 As individuals age, the prevalence of
AD increases significantly, with estimates of 19% for those aged 75 to
84 and 30% to 35% for those > 85 years old.43 Additionally, research
shows that individuals who inherit one copy of the APOE ε4 genotype
have a higher risk of developing AD, while those who inherit two copies
have an even higher risk.44,45 Notably, in the progressive MCI group,
females had an average age of 1.4 years older than males, suggesting
that females may be more prone to progression due to their longer
lifespan.

transcript, we obtain different vector embeddings for each NPT
interview. To increase the training data, we randomly sample from
each transcript to create several abbreviated versions that are then
encoded. In addition, the content of each subtest can be encoded sepa-
rately, resulting in eight specific embeddings. These embedding vectors
are generated by a deep learning–based model, the Universal Sen-
tence Encoder (USE).46 The USE is a pretrained neural network based
on the transformer architecture and has demonstrated a promising
downstream classification accuracy on dementia detection and other
tasks.27,47 The USE outputs a 512-dimensional vector for each embed-
ding. To simplify the downstream classification model, we perform
dimensionality reduction using a logistic regression-based recursive
feature elimination (RFE) method.48 Specifically, we perform logistic
regression-based RFE on the training data, systematically removing the
weakest feature as determined by the smallest absolute value of the
logistic regression coefficients.
2.5
Prediction procedure
We generate deep learning–based embedding vectors from either an
abbreviated version of a transcript or the content of one specific sub-
test. This results in eight embedding vectors associated with each
subtest, as well as multiple embedding vectors from the abbreviated
versions of one transcript. We then train a logistic regression model
on the quantitative data associated with one subtest content, result-
ing in eight different trained models and eight scores for the subtests.
However, the eight scores representing the subtests undergo a feature
selection process using performance error analysis. The embeddings
frommultipleshortenedversionsofeachtranscriptaretreatedasinde-
pendent input, and one logistic regression model is trained on all of
them, resulting in the generation of multiple scores for one transcript.
Although the abbreviated versions of a transcript are treated inde-
pendently during the embedding procedure, we take the average of
the logistic regression scores to create the transcript average score
(TAS). Finally, we feed the TAS score along with the selected subtest
scores into an ensemble logistic regression model to make the final
prediction of the likelihood of an individual with MCI converting to
AD within 6 years. Figure 3 illustrates the prediction process. By inte-
grating random abbreviation and subtest-specific embeddings through
data augmentation, our approach significantly enhances the model’s
data interpretation and accuracy. This includes generating the TAS
score from diverse transcript versions, alongside subtest evaluations
to improve our prediction process. This strategy enriches our model’s

data representation and predictive accuracy, leveraging both broad
and detailed transcript insights.
2.6
Validation and performance metrics
To evaluate our model’s performance, we used a stratified group k-fold
cross-validation approach, splitting the dataset into 10 folds. This divi-
sion allocated 90% of the data for training (across nine folds) and 10%
for testing (the remaining fold), with each segment serving as the test
set once to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Within this framework,
we also implemented an internal cross-validation within the training
phase for dimensionality reduction and feature selection. This nested
cross-validation strategy ensures the test data remain unseen until the
final testing phase, enhancing the validity and reliability of our results.
We conducted the stratified group k-fold cross-validation three times,
each with a distinct random seed, to accurately calculate the average
metrics and 95% confidence intervals for our model’s performance
assessment. The performance metrics considered for the evaluation
were classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score,
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
The AUC is a valuable measure that estimates the probability of the
classifier ranking a randomly chosen progressive MCI subject (positive
sample) higher than a randomly selected stable MCI subject (negative
sample). Sensitivity and specificity provide insights into the correct
classification of positive and negative subjects, while the F1 score
measures the trade-off between precision and recall.

RESULTS
Table 2 presents the average performance metrics of the logistic
regression model, including the 95% confidence interval for each met-
ric. The table is sorted in descending order based on AUC, with the
highest value listed first. The first row showcases the model’s per-
formance, incorporating text, demographics, APOE, and health factors,
achieving an AUC of 78.5% and an F1 score of 79.9%, marking the high-
est effectiveness observed. The subsequent two rows highlight models
that leverage text features along with readily available demographic
data such as age, sex, and education, also demonstrating strong predic-
tive capabilities with an AUC and F1 score of 77.8% and 79.4% for our
NLP model using only text features. The fourth row of the table reports
the performance of adding APOE data to the model using demographic
features, resulting in an AUC and F1 score of 71.7% and 75.7%. In
addition, we trained a model with only demographic features as input,
yielding an AUC of 68.8% as shown in row 6.
We also assessed a logistic regression model based on traditional
neuropsychological test scores, including assessments like Logical
Memory, Visual Reproductions, Paired Associate Learning Immediate
Recall, Similarity Test, BNT, and Verbal Fluency Test. The model’s per-
formance, detailed in the fifth row, shows an AUC of 71.3% and an F1
score of 75.5%, underscoring that our NLP model not only matches
but exceeds the predictive power of standard NPT scores. Addition-
ally, when using four health factors (blood glucose, body mass index,
presence of diabetes, and calculated low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) as
input to the logistic regression, the seventh row shows an AUC of
66.2% and F1 score of 72.5%. As the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) evaluates cognitive problems with thinking, communication,
understanding, and memory, the model based on MMSE yielded an
AUC of 60.7%. Other combinations of different features had no per-
formance improvement over the best models in the first three rows
of Table 2. Furthermore, the four health factors used in Table 2
(blood glucose, body mass index, presence of diabetes, and calculated
LDL) resulted from the performance error analysis of 14 health fac-
tors; see the supporting information and Figure 4 for the complete
analysis.

Based on the confidence intervals detailed in Table 2, the perfor-

While there may be some overlap in confidence intervals between
models using text features and baseline models, statistical analysis,
such as the paired t test, validates that the AUC for models using text
features is significantly improved, underscoring the efficacy of our NLP
approach in enhancing predictive accuracy.
Figure 5 displays the coefficients of our logistic regression model
using the text features and the demographics model output. The results
have been adjusted for continuous variables through z score nor-
malization (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
deviation), making the coefficients comparable. This figure represents
the distribution of logistic regression coefficients for different fea-
tures, highlighting their relative importance in the model’s predictive
process. By comparing the interquartile ranges and medians of coeffi-
cients for TAS and selected subtests against the demographic features,
we can observe a difference in their contributions. A higher median
value for TAS and subtests implies these variables have a stronger
predictive value, underscoring their role over demographic factors in
influencing the model’s prediction.

AD with an accuracy of 78.2% and a sensitivity of 81.1% in the held-
out test data, demonstrating strong predictive power over a 6-year
span. However, the specificity of predicting whether an individual with
MCI will progress to AD within 6 years was moderate, at 75%. To
reduce the costs associated with recruiting subjects for clinical trials,
it is important to improve the specificity. Nevertheless, the relatively
high sensitivity of our prediction tool makes it clinically applicable and
potentially beneficial for eventual neuroprotective therapies.49
Importantly, our method only uses features derived from speech
data in an automated manner, along with easily obtainable variables
such as age, sex, and education level. The proposed method offers a
non-invasive, accessible, and easy-to-administer AI-based predictive
approach because it does not require data involving laboratory tests,
genetic tests, or imaging exams. This makes it a promising candidate for
integration into remote assessment technologies. A major strength of
this study is its use of semantic features extracted from the structured
text data. This approach allows for the potential transferability of the
entire pipeline to other languages, leveraging the availability of tran-
scription tools that can transcribe from any language to English, and/or
powerful NLP models in different languages.50,51 As a computer-aided
decision-making tool, our method has the potential to mitigate inter-
clinician variability in selecting candidates for clinical trials and drug
tests, enhancing the consistency and reliability of participant selection
processes.52
The Results section indicates that adding demographic features to
text features does not enhance the model’s ability to predict the pro-
gression from MCI to AD. This contrasts with previous assumptions
about the predictive power of age and other demographics in relation
to degenerative diseases over extended periods. Even though there are
significant differences in demographics between stable and progres-
sive MCI groups, the use of text features alone outperforms the use of
demographic features. This underscores the strong predictive strength
of the engineered text features. Moreover, upon evaluating the perfor-
manceofthelogisticregressionmodelusingthetraditionalNPTscores,
we observed an AUC of 71.3%. This result indicates that our approach
outperforms conventional NPT scoring methods in this study. Further-
more, when we compared our model to a well-established cognitive
assessment score such as the MMSE score, text features demonstrated
higher predictive power. In addition, compared to other works that
used only non-invasive features,53,54 our model’s F1 score = 79.4% is
higher.Forinstance,theauthorsinonepaper53 predictedADtransition
within 9 years based on NPT scores provided by specialized clini-
cians, achieving an F1 score of 70.8%, whereas Grassi et al. achieved
an F1 score of 72.7% using sociodemographic characteristics, clinical
information, and NPT scores.54 These methods still require highly spe-
cialized personnel to generate the NPT scores while our method is fully
automated, making AD prediction accessible to all.
As depicted in Figure 5, our analysis revealed that subtests related
to demographic questions (DEMO), BNT, similarity tests (OTHER), and
WAIS emerged as the top features driving the performance of our
model. These sections of each transcript are key predictors for iden-
tifying the future incidence of AD. Thus, our approach facilitates the
identification of subtests that provide more informative insights for
predicting the future incidence of AD. This finding underscores the
potentialbenefitofusingamorestructuredinterviewtobettercapture
the language deficits that may underlie cognitive decline. Additionally,
after conducting a performance error analysis on 14 health risk fac-
tors, we found that variables such as blood glucose, body mass index,
diabetes, and calculated LDL were useful in predicting the develop-
ment of AD. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of
using automatic speech recognition and NLP techniques to develop a
prediction tool for identifying individuals with MCI who are at risk of
developing AD. Our method achieved high accuracy and outperformed
other non-invasive approaches. However, further prospective studies
with larger populations are necessary to validate the generalizability of
our models. Additionally, it is important to standardize the definition of
MCI across different locations to enable better comparison of results.
With continued development and refinement, our approach may con-
tribute to early intervention and selection in clinical trials for novel AD
treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
