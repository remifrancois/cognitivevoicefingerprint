It is known that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) influences the temporal characteristics of spon-
taneous speech. These phonetical changes are present even in mild AD. Based on this, 
the question arises whether an examination based on language analysis could help the 
early diagnosis of AD and if so, which language and speech characteristics can identify 
AD in its early stage. The purpose of this article is to summarize the relation between 
prodromal and manifest AD and language functions and language domains. Based on 
our research, we are inclined to claim that AD can be more sensitively detected with 
the help of a linguistic analysis than with other cognitive examinations. The temporal 
characteristics of spontaneous speech, such as speech tempo, number of pauses in 
speech, and their length are sensitive detectors of the early stage of the disease, which 
enables an early simple linguistic screening for AD. However, knowledge about the 
unique features of the language problems associated with different dementia variants 
still has to be improved and refined.

INTRODUCTION
Despite great efforts concentrated on disease modifying therapies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), halt-
ing the degenerative process has not been possible. For this reason, early diagnosis of AD became 
crucial in the management of the disease. Current pharmacological agents available for AD are 
more effective in the mild cases, even in the cases of mild cognitive impairments (MCI). It is well-
documented that manifest AD patients show markers of language deficit long before their diagnosis 
is confirmed (Mesulam et al., 2008) and this tendency is especially useful for detecting mild cognitive 
decline, the prodromal stage of AD (Garrard et al., 2005).
Diagnostic procedures of language functions play a major role in the detection process of the cogni-
tive deficits with different stages. Questions nevertheless remain whether the characterization of the 
linguistic profiles of MCI/AD cases is useful or not in the detection procedure. The purpose of this 
review is to summarize the main language deficits in relation to prodromal and manifest AD, focusing 
on the changes of different language domains (semantic, pragmatic, syntactic, and phonologic ones)

during the course of the disease. Additionally, the relationship 
between language and other cognitive functions in AD will be 
discussed.
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND LANGUAGE
Cognitive deficits involve executive function, reasoning, 
visuoconstructive, and language abilities. Language deficits 
typically become noticeable from the early stage of the disease 
(Morris, 1996). Naming disorders, impaired auditory and 
written comprehension, fluent but empty speech, and seman-
tic paraphasia are typical language deficits in AD, however, 
repetition abilities and articulation remain relatively intact 
(Appell et  al., 1982; Bayles et  al., 1992; Croot et  al., 2000). 
The different stages of the disease exhibit specific patterns of 
linguistic difficulties in a given domain. The following five 
domains of language are known: phonetics and phonology, 
morphology, lexicon and semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. 
These language domains are affected in different ways in AD 
(Bayles and Boone, 1982).
In the Table 1, we are going to summarize the language func-
tion measurements of MCI and different stages in AD. As the 
disease progresses (from MCI to severe AD), a continuous decline 
in language can be observed in AD patients (Kempler, 2004).
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS 
IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
In AD, language and memory functions are closely related since 
linguistic functioning requires memory functions. Difficulties 
in productive speech, speech comprehension, and memory 
functions overlap. Senile changes in language comprehension 
and expression entail the decline of global speech performance,

and a lapse in evocative memory puts constraints on the active 
vocabulary (Kempler, 2004).
In a summative work, the relationship between simple lan-
guage measures and cognitive impairment in AD was estimated 
by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the clinical 
dementia rating scale (CDR), respectively. Language measures 
included articulation, fluency (word-finding ability, hypofluency, 
hyperfluency), semantic fluency, repetition, and confrontational 
naming. A significant relationship was found between CDR and 
MMSE scores and all language measures apart from hyperfluency. 
Impairment in language fluency, animal naming, and confronta-
tional naming are common, especially in the case of impaired 
cognitive and global performance (Weiner et al., 2008).
It has also been shown that patients with AD show difficulties 
in performing tasks that tap semantic knowledge, such as naming, 
verbal fluency, or object recognition. These symptoms occur early 
and they increase during the course of the illness, suggesting early 
and progressive impairment of the semantic memory of these 
patients (Nebes et al., 1989). Briefly, semantic memory can be 
defined as the capacity to acquire and retain general knowledge 
about the world, containing basic facts and meanings, as well as 
words and their meanings. Several approaches have been put 
forward in order to test semantic memory, such as priming tests, 
category fluency, and object or picture naming (Hodges, 1994).
Another stream of research aims at the examination of lexical 
semantic memory (Balthazar et  al., 2007). According to these 
results, the three groups (control, amnestic MCI, mild AD) showed 
a continuum of decreasing cognitive ability in all cognitive tests. 
In semantic memory tests, the performance of amnestic MCI 
patients was similar to that of controls, but showed worse results 
on verbal fluency task, which involves semantic knowledge, as 
well as language use, executive function, and short-term memory. 
Thus, verbal fluency might have been influenced by short-term 
memory. As the disease progresses, other areas including the tem-
poral cortex are involved, which can explain the difficulties with

semantic knowledge in mild AD. It has been shown that amnestic 
MCI impairs episodic memory while the lexical semantic system 
is spared, which can be affected in the early phase of AD.
In summary, deficits in language and memory functions, 
especially in semantic memory are commonly found in patients 
with AD, even in the early phase. Therefore, the need can arise 
for developing a purely language-based screening test, which can 
serve as an early diagnostic tool for MCI.
NEURAL BASES OF LANGUAGE DEFICITS 
IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Considering the cognitive impairments in AD, the neural basis of 
episodic memory has been primarily investigated by the anatomi-
cal and functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI), or positron emission tomography (PET). So far, only a 
limited number of publications are available, which focus on the 
detection of organic or functional changes in the central nervous 
system underlying language impairments. For example, a recent 
investigation of healthy subjects and individuals with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) demonstrated a difference in 
the neuroanatomical bases of episodic and semantic performance 
(Hirni et al., 2013). Specifically, region of interest (ROI) analyses 
showed that episodic memory performance was associated with 
the bilateral entorhinal cortex/hippocampus (ERC/HP) head, 
whereas semantic memory performance was associated with left 
medial perirhinal cortex (mPRC) and bilateral ERC/HP head 
integrity suggesting that mPRC damage in very early AD may 
be detectable with common clinical tests of semantic memory if 
episodic memory performance is controlled (Hirni et al., 2013).
In another study, a 2-back versus 1-back letter recognition task 
was performed by MCI and AD patients, using DTI and fMRI. 
Significant hypoactivation was found in posterior brain areas and 
relative hyperactivation in anterior brain areas during working 
memory in AD/MCI subjects compared to controls. In MCI/AD 
subjects, impairments of structural fiber tract integrity co-occur with 
breakdown of posterior and relatively preserved anterior cortical 
activation during working memory performance (Teipel et al., 2014).
Posterior corpus callosum connects superior parietal, pos-
terior temporal, and occipital cortical areas (De Lacoste et al., 
1985), which include key nodes of working memory activation. 
The superior longitudinal fasciculus forms a large arc superior 
and lateral to the putamen connecting all four cerebral lobes, 
which has a main role in language processing in the human brain 
(Bernal and Altman, 2010; Axer et al., 2013). This area is known 
to be impaired in MCI and mild AD (Liu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 
2013) and is a possible reason for functional uncoupling of pre-
frontal and posterior brain areas during verbal working memory 
performance (Teipel et al., 2014).
LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS DURING THE 
COURSE OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
The impairment of the language functions in the course of AD 
may be characteristic not only for the given stage of the disease but 
also for its prodroma, MCI. During the total course of the disease, 
language seems to be impaired disproportionally, meaning that 
the semantic and pragmatic language systems are more impaired 
than syntax (Bayles and Boone, 1982). Impairments in the lexical, 
semantic, and pragmatic language functions are typically present 
in mild AD since they depend on cognition to a greater extent 
(Taler and Phillips, 2008; Tsantali et al., 2013). Articulatory and 
syntactic domains of language production remain intact until late 
stages of the disease (Croot et al., 2000).
In the following sections, relevant studies will be discussed and 
summarized in order to investigate language functioning during 
the course of AD, considering the most extensively researched 
language domains (Table 2).
Phonetics and Phonology in  
Alzheimer’s Disease
Temporal parameters of speech can be investigated in the 
language domains phonetics and phonology, more precisely, in 
spontaneous speech (Hoffmann et al., 2010; López-de-Ipiña et al., 
2013), in a reading aloud task (Martínez-Sánchez et al., 2013), 
and in spoken tasks (Satt et al., 2014).
In the MCI phase, the most characteristic linguistic changes 
are longer hesitations and a lower speech rate in spontaneous 
speech (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Roark et al., 2011; Jarrold et al., 
2014; Satt et al., 2014). The manually extracted acoustic features 
of spontaneous speech and an automatizing biomarker extrac-
tion process using automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been 
recently compared in MCI patients and control subjects (Tóth 
et al., 2015). The classification results provided by ASR-based fea-
ture extraction were just slightly worse than those of the manual 
method (Tóth et al., 2015).
The temporal parameters of spontaneous speech have also 
been investigated in mild AD and control subjects (Hoffmann 
et al., 2010). This study aimed to identify a speech parameter that 
might distinguish mild AD patients from normal individuals. 
The following aspects of spontaneous speech were included in 
the analysis: articulation rate, speech tempo, hesitation ratio, 
and grammatical error ratio. Results showed that articulation 
rate in mild and severe AD patients was significantly different 
from normal controls; furthermore, a difference among mild, 
moderate, and severe AD patients was also reported. Significant 
differences in speech tempo and hesitation ratio were found 
between all experimental groups, apart from moderate and 
severe AD patients, who performed similarly on both tasks. 
Grammatical error analysis showed significant difference 
between moderate and severe AD groups; however, this was not 
found when comparing normal subjects and mild AD groups 
(Hoffmann et al., 2010).
In another study, an automatic spontaneous speech analysis 
was also carried out to identify mild AD. It was suggested that 
shorter recording times reflect that for AD patients, speech 
requires more efforts than for healthy individuals: patients speak 
more slowly with longer pauses, as well as they spend more time 
to find the correct word, which in turn leads to speech disfluency 
or break messages (López-de-Ipiña et al., 2013).
A similar research studied the temporal organization of speech 
in AD patients and matched healthy controls with an oral reading

task. The following indices were analyzed: total duration of the 
reading task, number of pauses, pause proportion, phonation 
time, phonation – time ratio, speech rate, and articulation rate. 
The AD group showed impairment in all of these variables. 
Reduced speech and articulation rates, low effectiveness of 
phonation time, as well as increased number and proportion of 
pauses characterized their reading. The two temporal parameters 
with the greatest discriminatory capacity were speech rate and 
articulation rate. In sum, signal processing algorithms applied 
to reading fluency recordings were capable of differentiating 
between AD patients and controls with an accuracy of 80% based 
on speech rate. Thus, analyzing temporal parameters for read-
ing fluency, especially speech and articulation rates, allowed to 
distinguish between asymptomatic subjects and patients in mild 
AD (Martínez-Sánchez et al., 2013).
Although examining the temporal parameters of spontaneous 
speech, it is not clear which variables are capable of separating the 
mild AD group from the control group. Some researchers divided 
the mild AD group from the control group based on the articula-
tion rate, speech tempo, and hesitation ratio variables (Hoffmann 
et  al., 2010), whereas others suggested that speech rate and 
articulation rate are the best discriminating variables (Martínez-
Sánchez et al., 2013). Furthermore, some researchers emphasize 
the importance of break analysis as well (López-de-Ipiña et al., 
2013). However, there is an agreement that the temporal analysis 
of spontaneous speech is proven to be an effective method for 
spotting mild AD.
In moderate or severe AD, there are more and more serious 
temporal changes in spontaneous speech: hesitation number and 
time increase, compared to mild AD, and the mental lexicon is 
even more difficult to access (Hoffmann et al., 2010).
Lexical, Semantic, and Pragmatic 
Domains of Language in Alzheimer’s 
Disease
Mild cognitive impairment patients usually have trouble with 
finding the right word (Fraser et al., 2014; Garrard et al., 2014). 
As regards semantics and syntax, both seem to be impaired since 
fluency tasks and naming tasks show deficits; moreover, compre-
hension of sentences and texts and production of narrative speech 
are also impaired, concerning the semantic content and syntactic 
structures of speech (Juncos-Rabadán et al., 2010).
Alzheimer’s disease patients lack the distinctive semantic 
attributes of concepts: there is strong evidence that dysfunction 
in linguistic tasks is caused by the general cognitive impairment 
in AD (Feinberg and Farah, 1997). The most common and obvi-
ous language errors made by AD patients are semantic errors 
(Croot et al., 2000), namely that they use superordinate category 
names instead of the target name (Saito and Takeda, 2001) or 
circumlocutory speech with progressively impaired naming 
(Emery, 2000).
The semantic association test (SAT) is a tool for detecting 
disorders in verbal and visual semantic processing (Visch-Brink 
and Denes, 1993). In general, AD patients had significantly 
lower scores on SAT than controls. However, their data expose 
an incoherent relation between naming and semantic processing 
in AD. In contrast to semantic processing, the performance of

AD patients on naming fell within the normal range, implying 
that naming is independent of semantic processing in AD (Visch-
Brink et al., 2004).
Alzheimer’s disease patients typically have difficulties in tasks 
of confrontational naming and verbal fluency (Appell et al., 1982; 
Bayles et al., 1987). Semantic verbal fluency and phonological 
verbal fluency tests are widely used in diagnosis of AD and they 
are reliable indicators of language deterioration in the early detec-
tion of AD (Laws et al., 2010). Difficulties in word finding are one 
of the earliest manifestations of language breakdown in AD. This 
pattern of impairment has been implicated as the loss of semantic 
knowledge in AD (Hodges et al., 1992). Results from language 
tests and priming experiments clearly suggest altered intentional 
and automatic semantic processes in AD. However, the order 
in which these processes are impaired during the course of the 
disease is unclear (Duong et al., 2006).
Lexico-semantic impairments in AD have been attributed to 
abnormalities in intentional and automatic access to semantic 
memory. In a study, MCI, pre-AD, and normal elderly people 
were tested with intentional access tasks (picture naming and 
semantic probes), automatic access tasks (lexical decision and 
priming), and executive function tasks (Stroop and Stroop-
picture naming). Results indicated that the MCI group was only 
impaired in tasks of intentional access relative to the AD group, 
which showed impairment in all tasks. Since most MCI subjects 
eventually develop AD, the results suggest that the intentional 
access to semantic memory is impaired earlier compared to the 
automatic access. The AD individuals performed significantly 
different from normal controls in all four semantic tasks (Duong 
et al., 2006). AD subjects demonstrated slowing in lexical decision 
as well as increase in semantic priming, termed hyperpriming 
(Giffard et al., 2001, 2002), which speaks for abnormal automatic 
semantic processing. Abnormal performance has also been 
found in picture naming and semantic probe questions which 
require effortful semantic processing and search. The results 
confirmed the observation that subtle cognitive impairments, 
such as language impairment, may co-occur with the readily 
observed memory impairments (Petersen et  al., 1999, 2001; 
Ritchie et al., 2001).
Alterations in productive and receptive discourse-level 
processing have also been reported in MCI and mild AD. AD 
individuals generally produce shorter texts than the normal 
controls with less relevant information and multiple error types 
(incoherent/indefinite phrases, semantic and graphemic para-
phasia, and inability to abstract) and describe all pictorial themes 
(Taler and Phillips, 2008).
To sum up, we can say that the performance of AD patients is 
different compared to the control group in most of the semantic 
tasks. Changes in semantic processing (Petersen et al., 1999, 2001; 
Ritchie et al., 2001; Duong et al., 2006) trigger semantic errors in 
AD patients (Croot et al., 2000). Furthermore, impaired naming 
(Emery, 2000) and picture naming (Petersen et al., 1999, 2001; 
Ritchie et al., 2001), word finding difficulties, and abnormal verbal 
fluency are also present in this group (Appell et al., 1982; Bayles 
et al., 1987). Slow lexical decision could be one of the reasons 
behind all of these (Giffard et al., 2001, 2002). However, it should 
be noted that although lexico-semantic changes in AD have been 
intensively studied, research on pragmatics has rarely been car-
ried out among AD patients, thus it constitutes a potential field 
for future investigations.
CONCLUSION
On the basis of the existing research findings, we can state 
that the language deficit in AD is present in the early stage 
of the disease; therefore, the objective measures of the differ-
ent language domains are very important in the recognition 
of these patients. However, up to now, very few linguistic 
methods have been published, which are suitable for the early 
diagnosis of AD.
The disproportional impairments of language functions in the 
course of the disease have been proven by almost cohort studies. 
Large scale prospective longitudinal studies would be more ben-
eficial; however, they have been also missing. Additionally, more 
extensive use of functional neuroimaging techniques based on 
linguistic tasks in MCI or mild AD could lead to a more informed 
picture of the neural bases of language functions in the different 
stages of the disease.
In the future, additional work needs to be done to validate 
new methods across different settings (such as population-based, 
primary care, and memory clinics), age, and ethnic groups. 
Since the earliest measurable language domain is the temporal 
parameter of speech, the computerized analysis of spontaneous 
speech developed recently may be a promising approach in the 
early detection of AD. The combined use of the measurement of 
linguistic parameters and telemedicine technologies might per-
mit the screening of MCI or mild AD by an interactive test using 
a software package or mobile application. Having an accurate 
method to assess for dementia and predict risk in routine clinical 
care will aid decision-making and can ultimately lead to disease 
prevention.
