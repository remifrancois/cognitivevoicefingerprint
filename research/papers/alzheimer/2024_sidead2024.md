ABSTRACT
Introduction  There is emerging evidence that speech 
may be a potential indicator and manifestation of early 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Therefore, the 
University of Edinburgh and Sony Research have partnered 
to create the Speech for Intelligent cognition change 
tracking and DEtection of Alzheimer’s Disease (SIDE-­
AD) study, which aims to develop digital speech-­based 
biomarkers for use in neurodegenerative disease.
Methods and analysis  SIDE-­AD is an observational 
longitudinal study, collecting samples of spontaneous 
speech. Participants are recruited from existing cohort 
studies as well as from the National Health Service (NHS)
memory clinics in Scotland. Using an online platform, 
participants record a voice sample talking about their 
brain health and rate their mood, anxiety and apathy. 
The speech biomarkers will be analysed longitudinally, 
and we will use machine learning and natural language 
processing technology to automate the assessment of the 
respondents’ speech patterns.
Ethics and dissemination  The SIDE-­AD study has been 
approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC 
reference: 23/WM/0153, protocol number AC23046, 
IRAS Project ID 323311) and received NHS management 
approvals from Lothian, Fife and Forth Valley NHS boards. 
Our main ethical considerations pertain to the remote 
administration of the study, such as taking remote consent. 
To address this, we implemented a consent process, 
whereby the first step of the consent is done entirely 
remotely but a member of the research team contacts the 
participant over the phone to consent participants to the 
optional, most sensitive, elements of the study. Results will 
be presented at conferences, published in peer-­reviewed 
journals and communicated to study participants.
INTRODUCTION
In the current study, we will be analysing 
short recordings of individuals’ speech to 
detect early changes indicative of cognitive 
decline in the older adult population. The 
following section contextualises the emer-
gence of speech-­based ‘digital biomarkers’ in 
the neurodegenerative disease area.
Dementia is a major public health concern 
with over 55 million people currently living 
with dementia worldwide and recent projec-
tions reaching 78 million living with dementia 
by 2030.1 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the 
most common underlying pathology for the 
dementia syndrome, accounting for 60% to 
70% of all dementia cases2 3 and is also one 
of the leading causes of death in the USA.4 
Due to a long preclinical period in the AD 
pathology, dementia is a late-­stage manifesta-
tion of illness that has been developing years 
before dementia manifests.5 6 Though not yet 
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
	
⇒The main strength of this study is that it combines 
assessment of cognition with mood, anxiety and 
apathy assessment over time, through spontaneous 
speech, which can be collected remotely, unobtru-
sively and at scale.
	
⇒Another strength is its ability to relate patterns of 
speech collected while the participant is talking 
about their brain health to cognitive, clinical and 
functional outcomes through existing cohort data 
and National Health Service patient record data (op-
tional consent).
	
⇒Assessment by analysis of spontaneous speech, by 
relying on an inherently repeatable task that is not 
prone to practice effects, provides a way of avoid-
ing variability in cognitive assessment due to extra-
neous environmental or subjective factors, which 
could distort the true trajectory of cognitive perfor-
mance over time.
	
⇒A limitation of the study is that there is no way to 
control for variability in audio recording equipment, 
such as background noise, as participants will be 
using their own personal computers or mobile 
phones to collect the speech samples.
	
⇒Another possible limitation is that although the study 
will collect a standardised self-­assessment base-
line, there may be heterogeneity of data between 
the recruitment sources, which complicates the 
analysis.

globally available, recent pharmacological advances have 
yielded several new medications for the treatment of AD7 8 
and there are many other pharmacological approaches in 
progress, which necessitate detection of AD in its earliest 
pathological stage.
Dementia is an illness that causes neurodegeneration, 
whereby the brain gradually transitions from a healthy 
brain to brain failure.9 In the initial symptomatic stages, 
deterioration of brain health manifests as cognitive 
impairment, though over time once dementia develops, 
the cognitive impairment cascades into problems with 
daily functioning. Additionally, symptomatic AD may 
change an individual’s language, especially certain 
elements in speech such as elaboration (eg, making an 
argument clearer or providing examples) and attribution 
(eg, the ability to attribute characteristics to others).10 
What is more, evidence suggests that there is measur-
able difference between the speech patterns for individ-
uals who are ageing with and without cognitive decline. 
For example, AD has been associated with shorter word 
lengths, higher pronoun-­to-­noun ratio and reduced use 
of nouns11; reduced meaningful content expressed, a 
reduction of total output of expressive language and a 
preference for generic verbs and simple syntax.12 Acoustic 
features related to prosody and speech rhythms have also 
been found to be good predictors of AD.13 14
The significance of speech-­based markers relates both 
to research and clinical practice. For instance, though the 
primary outcomes measured in AD clinical trials focus 
on cognition and biomarker data such as brain imaging, 
analysing cerebrospinal fluid or blood tests,15 speech 
analysis could become a promising tool for detecting 
early neurodegenerative disease.16 A systematic review 
of studies looking to distinguish healthy ageing from 
cognitive decline in older adults using speech features 
concluded that most studies record a diagnostic accuracy 
over 88% for AD and 80% for MCI.13 Furthermore, a study 
by Eyigoz et al17 predicted future diagnosis of AD among a 
cognitively normal baseline of Framingham Heart Study 
participants and demonstrated that linguistic features 
from a single administration of the cookie-­theft picture 
description task out performed predictive models that 
incorporated genetic risk status, demographic variables 
and neuropsychological test results. Though limitations 
around specificity to underlying aetiology remain,18 the 
ease of remote data collection makes speech biomarkers 
a valuable area to explore.
In our own systematic review on the potential of 
using interactive AI methods to detect AD biomarkers, 
we concluded that when compared with traditional 
neuropsychological assessment methods, speech and 
language technology were at least equally discriminative 
between different groups.14 Interestingly, speech-­based 
markers have been found to detect AD pathology such as 
amyloid‐β status,19 but evidence also suggests that people 
with higher amyloid levels (both asymptomatic and those 
with mild cognitive impairment) exhibit a greater rate of 
decline in episodic memory and language,20 suggesting 
the causal relation between speech and AD pathology 
should be explored further. Some of the most promising 
AD markers in speech may be lexico-­semantic,21 meaning 
the use of deictic words such as those referring to specific 
time (eg, now, tomorrow), place (eg, here, at home) or 
person (eg, I, the person). While research on speech 
biomarkers is only beginning to emerge, we expect 
speech and language analysis to play a role in detecting 
and tracking preclinical AD in the near future.22 23
In addition to cognition, speech and language are indi-
cators of neurobehavioral outcomes such as mood, apathy 
and anxiety and have been used as input data in machine 
learning-­based emotion recognition models.24 Automatic 
methods for assessment of mood, anxiety and apathy 
could be an important component in AD detection and 
on-­going monitoring of patient outcomes. Apathy is the 
most common neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with 
AD, and its accurate detection is important in terms of 
treatment outcomes, carer education and well-­being.25 
Furthermore, mood disorders have also been linked to 
AD pathology.26 However, as highlighted above, one of 
the limitations in speech biomarkers is that they may indi-
cate deviations from typical function but not map to a 
specific neurodegenerative disease.27
To date, studies of neurodegenerative diseases involving 
speech have predominantly been laboratory based, and 
rarely included spontaneous speech. However, there are 
advantages in collecting spontaneous connected speech. 
Spontaneous speech can be captured in more natural 
settings over time, thus mitigating problems that might 
affect performance in controlled, cross-­sectional data, 
such as a participant having an ‘off day’ or having slept 
poorly the night before the test. Speech can also be 
collected remotely, using widespread mobile devices and 
smartphones, which facilitates data collection at scale and 
over time.28 The above practical considerations are crit-
ical as early recognition and intervention in AD may yield 
the most benefit.
This study explores changes in speech as potential early 
markers of pathological changes in AD. The Speech for 
Intelligent cognition change tracking and DEtection of 
Alzheimer’s Disease (SIDE-­AD) study is a longitudinal 
cohort study of individuals across the AD risk spectrum, 
those who are healthy volunteers and those engaged 
with secondary services for cognitive decline. The orig-
inal contribution of our research is collecting speech 
data for the explicit analysis of AD speech markers, using 
connected speech as the most evidence-­based modality 
for capturing relevant markers.
The study aims to develop digital speech-­based 
biomarkers for AD in order to assess disease status in the 
predementia stages in a real-­world population.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS
This is a remote observational longitudinal study devel-
oping speech biomarkers for use in neurodegenerative 
disease. The SIDE-­AD study involves collecting voice data

using an online platform and prompting individuals to 
talk about brain health (figure  1), using protocol V.4, 
dated 29 November 2023.
How the sample will be selected?
The selection of the participant population aims to create 
a risk spectrum of individuals with a low to high risk of 
AD. Therefore, the participant population includes indi-
viduals taking part in a longitudinal cohort study aimed 
at dementia prevention who are healthy volunteers but 
may have risk factors for dementia (such as genetic risk, 
increased amyloid or objective cognitive decline), indi-
viduals signed up for research registers in neurodegen-
erative disease and patients referred to clinical services 
who present with concerns around cognitive decline in 
National Health Service (NHS) memory clinics in the UK.
Participants will be identified through the different 
routes:
1.	 Participants taking part in the PREVENT Dementia 
study29
The PREVENT study is a longitudinal cohort study of 
individuals in mid-­life with n=700 participants, creat-
ing a spectrum of individuals from low to high risk of 
dementia. The participant information sheet (PIS) will 
be emailed by the PREVENT study team.
2.	 Participants will be identified through research reg-
isters such as Join Dementia Research, Scottish Brain 
Health Register, Scottish Health Research Register, the 
permission to contact list from the Scottish Dementia 
Research Interest Register held by the Neuroprogres-
sive and Dementia Network (NDN).
The PIS (SIDE-­AD study PIS) will be emailed to all el-
igible participants who have expressed an interest to-
wards the SIDE-­AD study.
3.	 Participants will be identified through NHS memory 
assessment services
Individuals will be either emailed the PIS electronical-
ly (online supplemental appendix 1) or handed the 
study PIS during routine clinic visits.
In order to achieve a spectrum of low to high individ-
uals at risk of AD, additional recruitment sources may be 
added to the SIDE-­AD study through protocol amend-
ments. Protocol amendments will be communicated to 
relevant parties in line with regulatory requirements.
Eligibility
Inclusion criteria
	
►Over 40 years old.
	
►Ability to carry out remote assessments (access to a 
computer/smart device).
	
►Have the capacity to consent.
	
►Participating in the PREVENT study or attending an 
NHS memory clinic.
Exclusion criteria
	
►Not able to speak English.
	
►Individuals who have not provided consent.
The SIDE-­AD study uses an age limit of 40 years and 
older to be consistent with the inclusion criteria in the 
PREVENT Dementia study eligibility criteria.
Sample size calculation
We aim to recruit a total of 450 participants over a 
10-­month period (October 2023–August 2024). The 
PREVENT study has 700 participants overall and at the 
first stage, only participants from Scotland (n=300) will 
be invited to take part in the SIDE-­AD study. Additionally, 
we estimate the number of eligible individuals in NHS 
clinical settings to be around 150 over 10 months, which 
will be sufficient for our planned analyses.
There is no a priori sample size calculation as the 
SIDE-­AD study will recruit from the PREVENT study, 
research registers and enrich the sample with a clin-
ical population recruiting from NHS memory clinics 
where all eligible individuals will be invited to take 
part in the SIDE-­AD study. We used Riley et al’s30 
approach to calculate the sample size and elaborate 
on the process below.

It is difficult to estimate precisely the optimal sample 
sizes and measurable effect sizes for machine learning-­
based studies such as SIDE-­AD. In the field of medical 
decision support systems, a commonly adopted rule 
of thumb for determining sample size in continuous 
outcome settings is to require two participants per 
feature (predictor) in the model. While this heuristic 
approach has been criticised for not taking into account 
the context of different studies,30 some theoretical justi-
fications for it have been offered in the pattern recogni-
tion literature for the case of classification.31 According 
to this approach, for relatively simple machine learning 
algorithms such as Euclidean distance and linear discrim-
inant analysis, lower bounds at 1.2 and 1.4 participants 
per feature have been proposed, for an expected proba-
bility of misclassification (PMC) at most 50% greater than 
an asymptotic PMC of 0.1. Using the enhanced Geneva 
Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) feature 
set32 as proposed here would imply a minimum of 114 
participants for a PMC at most 50% greater than a conser-
vative asymptotic PMC of 0.1 (90% accuracy). However, 
this estimate presupposes the use of a fairly simple linear 
model. We aim to collect data from larger numbers of 
participants, which will allow us to experiment with larger 
sets of speech features. In Riley et al’s paper,3 a method is 
proposed for estimation of sample sizes for continuous 
outcome regression models that aim to ensure that the 
data sample is large enough to estimate the model inter-
cept and residual variance precisely, and account for the 
risk of overfitting by setting adequate regularisation and 
optimism targets. While this approach only covers stan-
dard regression models, it provides more conservative 
sample size estimates. Taking a previous study on anxiety 
and depression recognition from speech conducted by 
our group33 as a basis, and assuming a model R2 of 0.3, 
a regularisation factor of 0.8, mean arousal and valence 
scores of 30, standard deviation (SD) of 22 and a reduced 
feature set of 40 features would require sample size of 
421 participants, according to the formula given in Riley 
et al.30 It is speculated30 that machine learning models 
require much larger sample sizes than simpler statistical 
models. We intend to use existing datasets containing 
speech samples from over 1000 subjects for data augmen-
tation and dimensionality reduction methods, such as 
Haider et al34 should our study’s sample size prove insuffi-
cient to train accurate predictive models.
What outcomes will be measured?
As this study aims to develop models for prediction of 
AD and related neurobehavioural outcomes, the primary 
endpoints of this study are measures of model prediction 
performance, namely, root mean squared error (RMSE) 
and coefficient of determination values for predicted 
cognitive scores, mood, anxiety and apathy predic-
tion ratings, for regression models and area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), sensitivity 
and specificity for classification into score categories (eg, 
high vs low mood, etc).
In terms of secondary endpoints, all participants in the 
SIDE-­AD study will self-­report the following outcomes, 
which are used as explanatory variables (table 1).

Individuals who are recruited through NHS services will 
have an optional consent for record linkage. For those 
participants who are recruited through NHS services and 
who consent to record linkage, changes in speech will be 
associated with routinely collected healthcare data.
Record linkage will include any/all the available 
outcomes:
	
►Neurodegenerative disease diagnosis
	
►Clinical outcomes (ADL, mood/anxiety and sleep 
measures)
	
►Neuropsychological outcomes (cognitive tests)
	
►Biomarker outcomes: genetic risk (ApoE4)
	
►Biomarker outcomes: amyloid levels
	
►Biomarker outcomes: τ levels
	
►Neuroimaging outcomes
We note that each of the above variables will be linked 
with the time stamp of when this was reported (eg, if a 
diagnosis is reported during one of the follow-­up appoint-
ments, time since diagnosis is controlled for in the 
analysis).
When and how?
The SIDE-­AD study is self-­administered remotely, though 
a member of the research team is available via contact 
details provided on the study PIS and study website. The 
assessment takes around 5 min to complete on a computer 
or smart device and the participant receives an email invi-
tation for follow-­up assessments every 3 months.
Interested participants follow a unique URL link to 
the SIDE-­AD research platform, where they will be asked 
to give consent (online supplemental appendix 2) and 
perform the baseline assessment. This is done remotely 
from the participants’ home with no direct involvement 
of the research team. All individuals in the SIDE-­AD study 
will be invited to provide speech samples through the 
online platform. Assessments, including speech sampling, 
will be done quarterly over the study duration.
Participant retention and completion of follow-­up are 
promoted through reminders in each follow-­up invitation 
that participants’ contribution is valued and voluntary.
Data analysis plan
We will conduct descriptive analysis of the sociodemo-
graphic information provided by the individuals, using 
simple tabulations. A lay language report with the survey 
results from the analysis of the data will be produced and 
made publicly available.
We developed the SIDE-­AD platform to collect speech 
data and limited background/self-­reported mood, 
anxiety and apathy data. The platform is used to monitor 
speech patterns over time. We will extract speech markers 
and evaluating a comprehensive set of acoustic features 
for modelling and prediction of cognitive function.
We will use the primary data for the purpose of devel-
oping models for the assessment of cognition, mood, 
anxiety and apathy. We will extract the following speech 
features and their most common statistical functionals, 
in total, 88 low-­level descriptors of the eGeMAPS as per 
Eyben et al32 from the collected speech signal.
	
►F0 semitone: F0 is determined physiologically by 
the number of cycles that the vocal folds make in a 
second, corresponding to prosodic aspects of speech.
	
►Loudness: the loudness of speech implies an increase 
in the vocal effort, which describes a strained or tense 
voice quality.
	
►Spectral flux: a low-­level feature that measures how 
quickly the power spectrum of a signal changes, used 
for voice activity detection.
	
►Mel-­frequency cepstral coefficients represent spec-
tral information from the speech signal, using a scale 
known as the ‘Mel-­frequency scale’, which is chosen to 
mimic the way humans perceive audio.
	
►Jitter: this indicates the variability or perturbation of 
F0 (ie, a measure of frequency instability).
	
►Shimmer: this is also a measure of F0 perturbation 
but is related to the amplitude of the sound wave or 
the intensity of vocal emission (ie, a measure of ampli-
tude instability). A normal healthy voice has a small 
amount of instability during sustained vowel produc-
tion, and tissue and muscle properties influence 
normal instabilities.
	
►F1, F2, F3: these are formant frequencies that relate to 
characteristics of the speaker’s vocal tract.
	
►Alpha ratio: the ratio between the energy in the low-­
frequency region and the high-­frequency region; a 
measure correlated to perceived voice quality.
	
►Hammarberg index: a spectral measure used as an 
energy distribution measure averaged across an 
utterance.
	
►Spectral slope (linear regression within bands 
0–500 Hz and 500–1500 Hz): a feature that has been 
investigated in connection with emotional speech.
Once these features have been extracted, we will apply 
the active data representation method, Haider et al,34 for 
dimensionality reduction, in order to extract the relevant 
dimensions of variation of the signal, while downplaying 
contingent voice features. Finally, we will train support 
vector regression models for automatic prediction of 
cognitive status (cognitive test scores), and mood, anxiety 
and apathy levels (self-­reported). We will also explore the 
relationship between these inferred and self-­reported 
neurobehavioral outcomes and cognitive function 
through Pearson correlation statistical test and through 
machine learning modelling, with mood, anxiety and 
apathy used as additional input features for the model, 
along with speech features. Where possible, we will 
discretise the cognitive and neurobehavioral outcomes 
(mood ratings can be assigned to three classes: depressed, 
healthy and (hypo)manic) and train classification models

to predict the corresponding classes. Performance of 
regression models will be assessed throughout the RMSE 
metric and the coefficient of determination. Performance 
of classification models will be assessed by computing the 
area under the ROC curve and sensitivity and specificity 
metrics. We will also generate speech transcripts from 
the recorded audio and extract word embeddings35 and 
general linguistic features found to be useful predictors in 
previous studies and compare the performance of models 
built with these features with those based on acoustic 
features. As we are collecting spontaneous rather than 
task-­based speech, we hypothesise that acoustic features 
will generalise better to the less constrained setting of our 
study.
Ethics and dissemination: ethical and safety considerations
We consider the main issues to pertain to the remote 
administration of the study. We have included contact 
details of the research team on every page of the survey 
and invite individuals to contact the team if they have 
any questions after reading the PIS accompanying the 
informed consent form. We have also engaged with the 
study sponsor Academic and Clinical Central Office for 
Research and Development (ACCORD) and the NHS 
information governance and IT security teams from 
the initial design stages of the study protocol to ensure 
remote consent is a secure method for consent. Our 
solution was to implement a two-­stage consent process 
whereby the first step of the consent is done entirely 
remotely but the participant has an option to consent 
to being contacted about linking to relevant sections in 
their memory clinic records. If participants consent to 
being contacted about record linkage, a member of the 
SIDE-­AD study research team contacts the participant 
and while the second step of the optional record linkage 
is electronic, it is only after a conversation with a member 
of the research team, which also allows the research team 
to assess capacity to consent. We note that the optional 
record linkage consent only applies to a small number 
of participants who are recruited through NHS memory 
clinics.
We considered this to be an appropriate process from 
both Good Clinical Practice and data security point of 
view, but this was also the favoured method to consent 
by our patient and public involvement (PPI) contributors 
who gave feedback at the design stage of the protocol/
survey. The feedback also considered the study to be fairly 
low impact only taking a few min to complete which does 
not necessitate face to face consent.
The other issue we have carefully considered is 
recording individuals’ speech. As collecting speech 
data for clinical research can be difficult due to privacy 
issues,36 we remind individuals not to disclose person-
ally identifiable information in the speech recording 
and we also explain that recording of the speech sample 
is for research purposes only and not part of clinical 
care.
The patient and public involvement statement
Patients and the public were first involved in the research 
at the design stage. We will also involve patients and public 
in the analysis of results and dissemination of findings. 
For the design stage, we contacted the NDN PPI panel 
in Scotland for feedback on our survey platform, PIS and 
consent forms. We received feedback from 10 individuals 
both healthy volunteers and those with lived experience 
of neurodegenerative disease. We carefully reviewed feed-
back and implemented changes proposed by the PPI 
contributors, these pertained not only to the online survey 
platform but also to the information provided about the 
study. Overall, the PPI input was favourable, and individ-
uals saw value in a remote study developing speech-­based 
biomarkers, which was perceived to have low participant 
burden but reward for taking part in research. Some of 
the issues raised involved giving more guidance on what 
people could talk about when they are asked to record 
speech and to add a box for optional comments for if 
individuals want to add a note about their recording to 
the research team. We also intend to involve PPI contrib-
utors in the analysis of results and dissemination of find-
ings to help prioritise what information to share, at which 
conferences/workshops and in which format. We plan to 
do this via the NDN; EPAD participant panel or National 
Dementia Carers Action Network (part of Alzheimer 
Scotland).
Dissemination plan
A possible dissemination opportunity will be the Scottish 
Dementia Research Consortium annual meeting. Addi-
tionally, we plan to publish findings from this study in 
peer-­reviewed scientific journals, international confer-
ences such as the AAIC, INTERSPEECH and ICASSP and 
communicate the study results to participants, healthcare 
professionals and the public by publishing a lay language 
report on the university website. We plan to publish a 
description of the data in venues like Nature Scientific 
Data and present it at the language resources and evalua-
tion conference.
Data storage
During the study, data will be securely stored on the 
University of Edinburgh’s DataStore service, where it will 
be accessible only to the research team and not shared 
outside of the research team in order to protect confi-
dentiality. No personal information about potential 
participants will be collected as study team will not have 
access to the individuals’ contact details who have been 
disseminated information about the SIDE-­AD study by 
their parent cohort or NHS clinical teams. Personal infor-
mation about enrolled participants will be stored securely 
and separately from research data.
After the study, for longer term preservation of the proj-
ect’s legacy and to ensure reproducibility of our analyses, 
anonymised research data will be stored on the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh Datashare (https://datashare.ed.ac.​
uk/handle/10283/8553), managed by the University
