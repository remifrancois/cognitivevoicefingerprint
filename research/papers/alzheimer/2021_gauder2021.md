ABSTRACT
Radio propagation modeling and prediction is fundamental for
modern cellular network planning and optimization. Conventional
radio propagation models fall into two categories. Empirical models,
based on coarse statistics, are simple and computationally efficient,
but are inaccurate due to oversimplification. Deterministic models,
such as ray tracing based on physical laws of wave propagation, are
more accurate and site specific. But they have higher computational
complexity and are inflexible to utilize site information other than
traditional global information system (GIS) maps.
In this article we present a novel method to model radio propa-
gation using deep convolutional neural networks and report signif-
icantly improved performance compared to conventional models.
We also lay down the framework for data-driven modeling of radio
propagation and enable future research to utilize rich and uncon-
ventional information of the site, e.g. satellite photos, to provide
more accurate and flexible models.

INTRODUCTION
In a wireless communication system, signal transmitted by a base
station can undergo attenuation as it propagates through space
before reaching a mobile user equipment (UE). The difference in
strength between the transmitted and received signal is commonly
referred to as path loss, usually measured in dB.
Path loss may be due to many effects, such as, free-space loss,
refraction, diffraction, reflection, aperture-medium coupling loss,
and absorption. Path loss can be influenced by terrain contours,
environment (e.g., urban or rural, vegetation or foliage, and the like),
propagation medium (e.g., dry or moist air), the distance between
transmitter and receiver, the height and location of antennas, the
antenna radiation pattern, and other factors.
Path loss is often used in analysis and design of link budget
of a telecommunication system, and is fundamental for modern
cellular network planning, a process to optimize the number of base
stations, the locations of these base stations, antenna selection and

gies, Inc.
parameter settings, etc, such that maximum coverage is achieved
with minimal cost.
Measuring path loss at all locations of interest is expensive, and
sometimes impossible when planning an area without existing base
stations. Therefore, it is desirable to predict path loss at a mobile
UE using radio propagation models without actual measurement.
Conventional radio propagation models are categorized into two
types: empirical and deterministic models [1, 2].
Empirical models describe the relationship between path loss
and environment parameters using multiple equations, which are
determined empirically using coarse statistics of data measured
under a limited number of settings, specified by environment pa-
rameters. Empirical models are computationally efficient, but are
usually inaccurate because they use only very limited parameters
to describe the environment.
Deterministic models on the other hand describe the environ-
ment using detailed information such as GIS maps, including build-
ing locations and shapes, terrain of the area, land use (clutter layer),
and antenna settings (location, azimuth, tilt and radiation pattern).
These models are derived from physical laws of wave propagation,
and in theory could be computed exactly by solving Maxwell’s
equations. Unfortunately, this approach requires unrealistically
complex mathematical operations and computing power. Ray trac-
ing technique is a popular approximation using geometrical optics
and knife edge diffraction theory [3, 4]. Deterministic models are
usually more accurate than the empirical ones, at the cost of more
computation. Furthermore, actual path loss is determined by much
richer information about the environment than conventional GIS
maps can provide, so the prediction by deterministic models still
has considerable error.
Radio propagation modeling is essentially a regression problem
in machine learning terms, and quite a few works have proposed to
use machine learning methods, mainly artificial neural networks,
to predict path loss [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. These works propose to use
regression neural network to predict path loss based on limited
description of the environment and are usually not site specific,
similar to empirical models. Fully connected neural networks with
one or a few hidden layers are proposed, and the input information
are usually numerical vectors with 10 to 20 dimensions, only able
to capture very coarse characteristics of the environment.

Recently deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) have
significantly outperforms other machine learning techniques in
computer vision related tasks, such as image recognition [11, 12,
13, 14, 15] and image segmentation [16, 17, 18]. These deep ar-
chitectures have exponentially more representation power and
significantly outperform conventional shallow learning methods.
Usually much more training data is also necessary for them to work
properly.
In this article, a data-driven modeling framework is proposed
to reformulate path loss prediction to an image regression prob-
lem, and utilize recent breakthrough of deep convolutional neural
networks in computer vision related tasks. We demonstrate how
input information to the model, such as maps and antenna param-
eters, can be translated into image tensors. We also proposed a
specific design of deep convolutional neural network architecture
that is tailored for radio propagation modeling. Results from large
amount of simulated and real field data show that the proposed
data-driven model performs significantly better than conventional
radio propagation models.
It is also worth pointing out that the framework we proposed
is flexible and can accommodate a variety of future designs. One
aspect is novel input information design. For example, building
materials and vegetation have large effect in high frequency radio
propagation, but they are expensive if not impossible to include in
conventional GIS maps. On the other hand, both building materials
and vegetation can be observed in satellite photos and can be easily
included into input tensors. Another aspect of future design is
researchers can invent better neural network architectures for more
accurate models.
The contribution of this work lies in the following aspects:
• We reformulate the radio propagation modeling to an image
regression problem and propose to use deep ConvNet to
solve it.
• We apply radio propagation domain knowledge and design
input tensors to capture most relevant input information.
• We select suitable neural network architectures based on the
nature of radio propagation modeling, as demonstrated in
Section 3.3.
• We tested the proposed model using both simulated and real
field data to show significant superiority over conventional
models, and the proposed model has already been deployed
as a Huawei internal tool and is being used by field engineers
over the world.

CONVENTIONAL RADIO PROPAGATION
MODELS
2.1
Empirical Models
There are a number of commonly used empirical models, for exam-
ple, Okumura-Hata model [19], Stanford University Interim model
[20], standard propagation model (SPM) [21] and Walfisch-Ikegami
model [1, 2].
The above models all use a few parameters and equations to
characterize typical classes of radio links such as urban, suburb
and rural. The parameters are determined based on measured and
averaged losses in the aforementioned typical classes of ratio links.
Thus empirical models are not site-specific, i.e., they use exactly
the same parameters for two different sites as long as the sites fall
in the same link category.
For example, the Okumura-Hata model is valid for microwave
frequencies from 150 to 1500 MHz, and is suited for both point-to-
point and broadcast communications, and covers mobile station
antenna heights of 1-10 m, base station antenna heights of 30-200
m, and link distances from 1-10 km. The Okumura-Hata model uses
separate sub-models for the urban, suburban and rural environ-
ments. The urban model is formulated as follows.
𝐿𝑈= 69.55 + 26.16 log10 𝑓−13.82 log10 ℎ𝐵
−𝐶𝐻+ [44.9 −6.55 log10 ℎ𝐵] log10 𝑑
(1)
For small or medium-sized city,
𝐶𝐻= 0.8 + (1.1 log10 𝑓−0.7)ℎ𝑀−1.56 log10 𝑓
(2)
For large cities and carrier frequency in 150MHz ≤𝑓≤200MHz,
𝐶𝐻= 8.29(log10(1.54ℎ𝑀))2 −1.1
(3)
And for large cities and carrier frequency in 200MHz ≤𝑓
≤
1500MHz,
𝐶𝐻= 3.2(log10(11.75ℎ𝑀))2 −4.97
(4)
𝐿𝑈is the path loss in urban areas in decibel (dB). ℎ𝐵is the height
of base station antenna in meter. ℎ𝑀is the height of mobile station
antenna in meter. 𝐶𝐻is the antenna height correction factor. 𝑓is
the carrier frequency in Megahertz. 𝑑is the distance between the
base and mobile stations in kilometer.
The models for suburban and rural areas are just slightly modi-
fied version of the above model and are omitted here.
SPM, derived from Okumura-Hata model with a few more pa-
rameters, is another commonly used model in industry, and we will
compare our proposed method with SPM in Section 4.
As we can see, the disadvantage of empirical models is that
they use very limited input information and parameters to coarsely
characterize radio links, so the prediction can be very inaccurate.
In our experience, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between
the un-calibrated prediction and ground truth is typical around
12-15dB.
2.2
Deterministic Models
Ray tracing techniques based on geometrical optics [3, 4] produce
the most widely used deterministic path loss models. Reflection,
scattering and diffraction are modeled and calculated using ray
tracing, and the effects are combined as shown in Figure 1.
The input to ray tracing models contains much more information
about a specific site than that of empirical models. GIS maps, often
containing building layers (specifying heights, shapes and locations
of buildings), terrain layers (altitude of ground) and clutter layers
(categorized land use), are typically used as input to ray tracing.
Examples of these layers can be found in Figure 2, where the values
in each layer are typically normalized.
Antenna parameters such as location, height, azimuth, tilt and
radiation pattern are also required in ray tracing.
Ray tracing can calculate deterministic prediction of path loss at
any specified points. With site-specific and rich input information,
it is usually more accurate than empirical models. However, many
factors affecting radio propagation such as the material of building
enclosure and density of vegetation are not available in typical

GIS maps, resulting in prediction error (measured in RMSE) close
to 10dB. Thus, to perform well for a specific site in practice, ray
tracing models require calibration which is essentially over-fitting
a few parameters to measurements from the same site using ex-
pensive drive tests. Moreover, in a new site planning task, these
measurements are outright not available.
Ray tracing based radio propagation models are very complex
and are implemented as commercial softwares by several compa-
nies implementing their proprietary technologies. They are usually
very computationally intensive and are often too slow for cellular
network planning, which is essentially an optimization process
with thousands of steps and each step recalculates the path loss of
the whole area under consideration.
Another disadvantage of ray tracing models is that unconven-
tional input information such as satellite photos of areas cannot
be easily incorporated into the models. These new sources contain
even richer information than traditional GIS map layers.

PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK
ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING
In this section we present the details of proposed data driven prop-
agation model, including input tensor design, neural network ar-
chitecture and training methods.
3.1
Problem Formulation
We observe that the inputs to ray-tracing based propagation models
include GIS map layers, which are essentially numerical matrices
and can be considered as the channels of an image, as shown in
Figure 2. Each pixel of the image here is corresponding to a square
area patch of 𝑚by 𝑚meters in the physical world, where 𝑚is
the resolution of GIS map. Typical resolutions of an GIS map are 5
meters, 10 meters and 20 meters.
Ray-tracing based models also utilize engineering parameters
such as antenna location (latitude, longitude and height), orienta-
tion and radiation pattern as input information. These parameters
are not in matrix format and cannot be directly incorporated into
input image tensors. There are two possible ways to include these
inputs into machine learning frameworks, e.g., neural network ar-
chitectures. We can keep the original format of these engineering
parameters and use as scalar inputs to a neural network in parallel
to the image tensor constructed with GIS map layers. By this de-
sign we are asking the neural network to learn some underlying
mechanisms on these parameters which we already know with
simple physics. We think a better approach is to translate these
parameters into additional channels of the input image tensor so
that we have a unified input in image format. By these translations,
we are essentially applying domain knowledge into the input tensor
design, as will be demonstrated in the next subsection.
Propagation models predict path loss values at each location in
an area, which can be gridded into square patches of 𝑙by 𝑙meters. If
we assume the path loss at any point within a patch to be the same
(a common practice by field engineers), the output can be formatted
into a matrix of path loss values, which can also be considered as
an image with each pixel corresponding to a small area patch of 𝑙
by 𝑙meters. The intensity of a pixel is set to the path loss value at
the square patch representing the pixel. Note that in practice 𝑙is
typically larger than or equal to 𝑚.
Thus the prediction process is essentially an image-to-image re-
gression problem, i.e., mapping from one image domain to another.
Instead of using ray tracing techniques to calculate the mapping, we
propose to use an alternative machine learning and data driven ap-
proach to learn the mapping. More specifically we proposed to use
a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) as the propagation
model and use simulated and real field data to train the ConvNet.
Details of the network architecture and training methodology will
be presented later in this section.
3.2
Input Tensor Design
One key aspect to use a ConvNet as propagation model is the design
of input tensor, such that all necessary information is organized in
a format to be utilized effectively by the neural network.
We design the input to be a 3-dimensional tensor, with the shape
of 𝐶×𝑊× 𝐻. 𝐶is the number of channels defined below.𝑊and 𝐻
are the width and height (in pixels) of the target area and they are
design parameters. For example, if the GIS map has a resolution of
𝑚= 5 meters and we would like to predict the path loss within an
area of 1000 by 1000 meters, the width and height of the patch are
both 200 pixels.
As mentioned previously, layers (building, terrain and clutter) of
GIS maps are naturally image channels, while engineering parame-
ters have to be translated into extra channels of the input image
tensor.
Instead of using extra channels to encode the latitude and lon-
gitude of the antenna, we propose to use the 2-D location of the
antenna as the center to cut out a map patch (with all three layers)
from the whole map. Subsequent channels also use the same center.
In practice the antenna can be either installed on a small tower
on top of a building, or hang on the side. We encode the antenna
height information in a channel of the input tensor where each
pixel has the same value representing the antenna height in meters.
With the above intuition, we design the input tensor with 8
channels and summarize each channel as follows:


---

Figure 2: Channels of input tensor to PLNet.
• Clutter channel contains the clutter layer of a GIS map,
which categorizes each pixel into one of the surface fea-
ture types, such as sea, forest, urban, river, lake, village and
other ground cover information. It is a categorical value and
usually numericalized as integers from 1 to 21.
• Building channel contains the building layer of a GIS map,
which describes the general outline and height information
of buildings. If there is building on a pixel, the value of the
pixel is the height of building at the pixel. If there is no
building on the pixel, the value is simply zero.
• Terrain channel contains the terrain layer of a GIS map,
describing the altitude of each pixel, which is normalized by
subtracting the lowest point in the map patch.
• Azimuth channel indicates the horizontal angle difference
between the line of sight from each pixel to the antenna and
direction of main lobe.
• Tilt channel indicates the vertical angle difference between
the line of sight from each pixel to the antenna and direction
of main lobe.
• Antenna height channel is designed to encode the height
of antenna simply with the height in meters at each pixel of
the map patch.
• Frequency channel describes the frequency of carrier sig-
nal. Signals with different carrier frequencies usually have
different attenuation, hence different path losses. We simply
copy the frequency value of a sample (the carrier frequency
of the base station) to each pixel.
• Antenna Gain channel describes the antenna radiation pat-
tern, i.e., how the radio energy is distributed in the space
around antenna. We assume the 3-D radiation pattern is in-
tercepted by the terrain surface below the antenna, and the
gain at each pixel on the surface is filled in this channel of
the tensor.
Examples of the channels are shown in Figure 2. Note that in this
framework, the input tensor can be easily modified when new
information is available. For example, satellite photos of an area
can be incorporated as an additional channel for the input tensor.
3.3
Network Architecture
Referring to the conventional propagation models, we observe
that the path loss at a specific location is determined by both the
macro condition of the environment such as the overall density of
buildings in the area, and the micro condition close to the receiver
such as the number of walls nearby and their specific locations.
To capture the above characteristics, a good neural network ar-
chitecture for path loss prediction should assemble different levels
of abstraction inside a neural network to form predictions. We pro-
pose to use a U-Net [18] type of architecture, which is also known
as encoder-decoder with skip connections. These skip connections
are critical and serve as the combinations of various abstraction
levels. The detailed architecture is shown in Figure 3.
In all the convolution and de-convolution layers, we use 3x3
kernel size and set stride to 2. Padding is applied such that feature
map size is only altered by striding. Note that in Figure 3 the input
tensor was designed to have the same width and height as the

output tensor (path loss matrix), i.e., the input map layers has the
same resolution as the path loss prediction. If they have different
resolution, it is easy to modify the architecture to up-sample/down-
sample the path loss matrix in the width and height dimensions.
We dub our neural network PLNet for easy reference later in this
article.
3.4
Supervised Training
The most straight forward way to train PLNet is supervised train-
ing. The input tensors are based on engineering parameters of
base stations and GIS maps, constructed according to Section 3.2.
Corresponding labeled path loss matrices are collected from field
measurements or alternatively from commercial path loss simula-
tors. Details about data generation will be explained in Section 4.
With the labeled path loss matrices (supervisors) for all the training
samples, we can use mean absolute error (MAE) or mean square
error (MSE) as the loss function for training. MAE is defined as
follows and MSE can be defined similarly,

of the path loss matrix. Y𝑖(𝑗,𝑘) refers to path loss value at the 𝑗𝑡ℎ
row and 𝑘𝑡ℎcolumn of the ground truth path loss matrix of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ
sample.
Note that in field collected data not all pixels have valid measure-
ments, because it is not realistic to ask road testing equipment to
traverse every single pixel in the area. Actually it is not uncommon
that only 5-10% of the pixels in a path loss matrix have measured
values. Pixels without valid measurements should be excluded from
the calculation of loss function, hence will not affect the gradient
back propagation. Just clamping the error from these pixels at zero
will effectively prevent them from interfering the training process.
4
EXPERIMENTS
The proposed method is tested with both simulated data and real
field data. We use simulated data in addition to real field data for
two reasons.
First, it takes time and effort to collect significant amount of
field data to train PLNet from scratch, and using simulated data to
pre-train PLNet can benefit prediction accuracy when only small
amount of real data is available. In our case, the pre-training is effec-
tive because, in both the simulated and real data, the input tensors
have the same distribution, i.e., they are both constructed using
GIS map layers, a set of know antenna radiation patterns, and same
ranges of antenna parameters. The only difference between the
simulated and real data is the path loss values (supervisors), so sim-
ulated data are especially useful to train lower level representations
in PLNet.
The second reason is that field data are usually proprietary and
there is no open data set for path loss prediction problem. For
other researchers to test our proposed method, GIS map layers and
commercial path loss simulators (ray tracing based) are available to
the public (some may charge license fees). The simulator we used
in generating simulated data is the “Volcano propagation model"
developed by Siradel SAS [22].
To generate simulated data, We use GIS maps of 40 cities around
the world, and randomly select suitable locations to “install" (virtual)
antennas. Note that the selected antenna locations need to be far
enough from each other to ensure independence among samples.
We also select antenna radiation patterns randomly from a set of
known antennas, and set the antenna parameters such as azimuth,
tilt and transmitting power randomly. Given the GIS maps and

antenna parameters, Volcano simulator is used to calculate the
corresponding path loss matrices. We managed to generate more
than 800,000 simulated samples.
We also collected about 400,000 field data samples using drive
test or mobile measurement report (contains GPS locations and
received signal power) from more than 50 cities worldwide. As
pointed out in Section 3.4, not all pixels have valid measurements,
so we adjust the cost function and back propagation accordingly as
described in Section 3.4.
We increased the effective number of both simulated and field
samples by data augmentation techniques such as reflection and
rotation.
Root-mean-square error (RMSE) is used as the metric for predic-
tion accuracy and it is calculated by averaging over all pixels and
samples.

4.1
Results with Simulated Data
First we clarify that the results from this subsection, i.e., results
using simulated data (generated from ray tracing based models), are
to demonstrate that PLNet has the capacity to capture meaningful
patterns from the input tensor by "learning from ray tracing". In
real application, PLNet will compete with ray tracing based models,
and we show in the next subsection that PLNet trained by real field
data outperformed ray tracing significantly.
We use the simulated data from 36 cities (728,574 samples) to
train PLNet, and data from the other 4 cities (96,724 samples) to
test the performance of PLNet.
It takes about 80 epochs for the training to converge, and we
achieve test performance of RMSE = 7.48dB using data from the 4
test cities.
Samples of predicted and ground truth (calculated by Volcano in
this case) path loss matrices are shown in Figure 4. The predicted
path loss matrix captures the overall patterns of the ground truth,
but it is a little blurred as a result of using MSE/MAE as loss function.
We also visualize the convolutional filters of the first layer in
Figure 5. The original PLNet has 3 × 3 convolution filters for each
channel and it is hard to visualize such small filters, so we increase
the filter size of the first layer filters to 11 × 11 just for visualiza-
tion purpose. We can see that the filters for building and terrain
channels are indeed trained to discover low level patterns of the
corresponding map layers.
There are two interesting observations. First, the filter patterns of
the terrain channel is wider and smoother than those of the building
channel. This is because buildings have much sharper edge in map
compared to smooth changing terrains. Second, the filter patterns
are similar to the ConvNets trained for image recognition purpose,
with the exception of some patterns having distinctive highlighted
pixels. When these filters convolve with the input building or terrain
channels, they search for higher buildings or terrains near the
current location. This is because protruding objects can reflect
electromagnetic waves and affect radio propagation.
From these results, we can see that the lower layers of PLNet are
trained to capture patterns of input map, even though it is trained
with simulated data generated by raytracing models. Thus it can
be a good pre-training in the case where real field data is limited.
4.2
Results with Field Data
Field collected data from 48 cities world-wide (319,350 samples) are
utilized to train our PLNet, and data collected from another 4 cities
(8,316 samples) are used to test the performance of PLNet against
empirical and ray-tracing based methods. The results are shown in
Table 1, where PLNet ST stands for PLNet by supervised training,
and SPM is a widely applied empirical model in industry. We can
see the proposed PLNet out-perform the conventional methods by
a large margin in each test city.
We also plot samples of predicted path loss matrices by PLNet
and conventional methods in Figure 6. Note that only the center
area of the ground truth path loss matrix has valid values. PLNet
predictions are more consistent with ground truth and are less
dramatic in the surrounding area.

Because of the large errors, both empirical and ray-tracing based
methods recommend to “calibrate" their models before actual pre-
diction. Basically calibration is overfitting the conventional models
to certain region of consideration, for example a city. It is worth
pointing out that in many cases data required by calibration are not
available, for example, in new construction of cellular networks,
where no base station has been constructed yet. In other cases,
data required by calibration has to be recorded through expensive
road test. So PLNet has considerable advantage here because it can
perform well without calibration.
But for the sake of completeness, we present the performance
comparison after calibration. A map of City D is shown in Figure 7,
where the calibration data is collected from the roads in blue color,
and the data collected from roads in red color are used for test after
the calibration.
Both SPM and Volcano use calibration data to fine-tune a few
parameters designed for calibration [22]. For PLNet, we use the
calibration data to fine tune the neural network for a few epochs.
The RMSE for SPM and Volcano are 9.50dB and 8.53dB respectively,
improved from the un-calibrated performance. PLNet still has the
best accuracy with RMSE = 7.81dB.
PLNet also has significant computation speed advantage over
ray tracing based method. To predict the path loss matrix of a single
cell with 320 × 320 pixels, Volcano needs 30 seconds (8-core Intel
i7 CPU), while PLNet only needs 0.33 seconds (implemented in Ten-
sorFlow with one Nvidia Titan Xp GPU). Of course PLNet benefits
from GPU computation, but at this time we are not aware of any
ray tracing based path loss prediction software taking advantage
of GPU acceleration.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we presented a new method to predict the radio
propagation path loss using a deep convolutional neural network,
which we dub as PLNet. We designed the input tensor to PLNet
to include detailed GIS map layers and antenna parameters. We
also proposed network architecture of PLNet that are tailored for
this application. Using real field data, we showed that the proposed
method is significantly more accurate than conventional methods
and can also be computed much faster using modern GPUs.
