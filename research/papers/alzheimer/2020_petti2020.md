Abstract
Background and Objectives: Population rapid growth and demographic shift is leading
to a rise in neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). Evidence indicates that MCI is not the earliest phase of prodromal AD. Subjective
Memory Decline (SMD) refers to a self-perceived decline in cognitive abilities compared to
previous functioning levels in individuals with normal cognition. Language impairment
represents a critical marker of neurodegenerative disorders and early memory decline in
healthy older adults. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA
Statement guidelines. The inclusion criteria of the selection process were set as follows:
(1) All studies analyzed spontaneous speech samples in individuals with SMD or individu-
als with +αβ amyloid. (2) Studies reported language performance indicators (e.g., lexical,
syntactic, semantic, phonetic, or fluency measures) derived from spontaneous speech.
(3) The study population included participants with SMD based on recognized diagnos-
tic criteria or self-reported cognitive complaints without objective cognitive impairment.
(4) Studies were written in English. (5) The time frame of studies was 5 years. Results: The
present work is a review of speech features—particularly from spontaneous and narrative
speech—and methods that can serve as sensitive indicators of early cognitive changes
due to AD pathology. Conclusions: Spontaneous speech analysis, through acoustic and
temporal parameters such as silence duration, phrasal segment length, and speech segment
frequency, offers a rich window into the subtle cognitive and linguistic changes that reflect
early memory decline in healthy older adults. Spontaneous speech performance could be a
scalable, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic tool in proactive cognitive health.

1. Introduction
Population rapid growth and demographic shift is leading to a rise in neurodegenera-
tive disorders such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [1]. MCI represents a
transitional phase between normal aging and dementia, where individuals retain most func-
tional abilities despite exhibiting neuropsychological impairments [2], and is considered a
significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [3]. Extensive research has explored
MCI as a predictor of AD, including the development of psychological assessments target-
ing cognitive domains affected by MCI and dementia to distinguish healthy individuals
from those exhibiting clinical symptoms [4].
However, evidence indicates that MCI is not the earliest phase of prodromal AD, high-
lighting the need for earlier disease detection to enable more effective interventions [5,6].
Some individuals report experiencing subtle changes in memory and cognitive function
before any detectable cognitive impairment. Subjective Memory Decline (SMD) refers
to a self-perceived decline in cognitive abilities compared to previous functioning levels
in individuals with normal cognition [7,8] and has been recognized as a key factor in
identifying prodromal AD [9]. The association between SMD and actual memory func-
tion remains unclear. Thus, those experiencing SMD report subjective memory issues or
changes that are too minor to be detected by standard cognitive assessments [10]. However,
individuals with these concerns tend to exhibit greater objective memory decline, lower
overall cognitive performance, and poorer perceived health compared to those without
SMD [11]. In the literature, SMD is also referred to as subjective cognitive decline (SCD),
subjective memory impairment (SMI), and subjective cognitive complaint (SCC). While
these terms vary slightly in definition, they all generally describe an individual’s subjective
perception of their cognitive abilities.
Although there are no globally accepted or widely used criteria for diagnosing SCD,
according Jessen and colleagues (2014), the SCD-I Working Group has introduced the SCD-
plus criteria as a guideline [6]. These criteria incorporate biomarkers along with specific
characteristics, such as self-perceived memory decline and the perception of having worse
memory performance compared to peers of the same age. According to the SCD-I Working
Group, the diagnostic criteria for SCD include (a) a subjective sense of worsening memory
that is not linked to depressive symptoms, (b) the absence of objective cognitive deficits
based on neuropsychological assessments, and (c) classification at stage 2 of the disease as
defined by the Global Deterioration Scale (CDR) [12].
1.1. Spontaneous and Connected Speech as Markers of Detection in Cognitive Decline
Language impairment represents a critical marker of neurodegenerative disorders;
however, the absence of a standardized terminology system for characterizing these im-
pairments contributes to substantial inter-rater variability among clinicians. Recently, the
application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and automated speech analy-
sis (ASA) has emerged as a novel and potentially more objective approach for evaluating
language function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) [13].
Spontaneous speech is speech produced with minimal premeditation, constitutes
effortless, natural, content-driven, and meaningful communication, and is used to describe
unscripted, real-life verbal production reflecting cognitive–linguistic processes [14]. Studies
have shown that individuals with high amyloid burden, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s pathol-
ogy, exhibit a reduction in the use of specific words during spontaneous speech tasks. Other
studies have focused on word count in semantic fluency or picture description tasks for
classification purposes among MCI, SMD, and healthy older adults [15,16]. Moreover, ma-
chine learning techniques applied to paralinguistic features from brief spontaneous speech

protocols have proven effective in distinguishing between varying degrees of cognitive
impairment, including SCD, MCI, and AD [17]. These findings underscore the potential of
speech analysis as a non-invasive, cost-effective method for early detection and monitoring
of cognitive decline.
The analysis of connected speech has gained increasing importance over the past
two decades, particularly in AD research, due to its ability to simultaneously engage
multiple cognitive processes such as semantic storage and retrieval, executive functions,
and working memory.
Connected speech is a term used to refer to any spoken language that flows continu-
ously, not just isolated words, including all the sound changes that happen when one word
connects to another in spontaneous speech [18].
Specifically, it refers to continuous sequences of spoken language where words flow
naturally and phonetic/phonological processes (like assimilation, elision, and liaison) occur
across word boundaries. Compared to isolated tasks like picture naming, connected speech
offers a more comprehensive and ecologically valid assessment with minimal participant
burden [19]. Although most studies have focused on individuals with mild to moderate AD,
retrospective analyses [20,21] have identified linguistic changes as early as the MCI stage.
Nevertheless, detecting subtle, preclinical language impairments remains challenging,
partly due to the strong interdependence of language and memory functions and the lack of
standardized methods to differentiate between them. Furthermore, distinguishing language
changes in MCI from those related to normal aging or SCD is difficult [19]. Simultaneously
quantifying both memory and language impairments may enhance diagnostic sensitivity
and provide valuable prognostic information.
1.2. Speech Domains Connected to AD, MCI, and SMD
While episodic memory impairment or memory loss is a defining feature of AD,
patients also develop key language deficits as a consequence of multiple cognitive impair-
ments due to focal brain damage [22]. These can manifest as a decline in lexical semantic
knowledge and difficulties in finding the right words (i.e., anomia and semantic para-
phasias), and following a conversation, their fluency and rate of speech (phonetic level) are
reduced while using grammatically correct but content-poor sentences [23–27]. Based on a
number of studies, morphosyntactic processing remains mostly intact at first; nonetheless,
individuals with AD make significantly more inflectional errors (mistakes with prefixes
and suffixes that change a word’s form) than healthy older adults [25,28–31]. Critically, at
the pragmatic level, their ability to hold a cohesive conversation also suffers, impacting
how they link ideas (referential/temporal cohesion), maintain clarity, and organize their
speech [32–35].
Verbal deficits observed in MCI mirror those of early-/moderate-stage dementia [36],
specifically involving naming, verbal fluency, and semantic knowledge, where pragmatic
skills seem to be the most affected area. It is well documented that these discourse issues
are often the earliest detectable signs of AD pathology, sometimes appearing years before
other memory or cognitive problems are formally diagnosed [37,38]. Therefore, analyzing
these language markers is promising for both early detection and large-scale screening
for dementia.
Studies regarding SMD deficits in language domains are sparse. However, some recent
studies indicate that word-finding patterns, especially those related to specific and concrete
words, may be sensitive indicators for early cognitive changes such as SMD [39–41]. The
association with amyloid burden in SMD populations further supports their potential as
early biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Specifically, Verfaillie et al. (2019) found
that less use of words referring to human characteristics and concrete nouns, as well a

lower use of content words, was associated with higher amyloid burden [40]. This indicates
that a reduction in the density of meaningful words in spontaneous speech may reflect
underlying neuropathological changes. In a longitudinal study (5-year study follow-up),
Maruta and Martins (2019) provide insight into word retrieval efficiency [39]. While not
directly measuring word-finding difficulties, poorer performance on semantic fluency tasks
over time may reflect increasing challenges in lexical access. Another longitudinal study
(5-year follow-up) by Reeves et al. (2023) indicates that a reduced word count combined
with an increased frequency of interjections, or a lower narrative discourse (ND) score, was
a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline [41].
1.3. Linguistic Metrics in Connected and Spontaneous Speech
Current traditional methods of linguistic skills’ evaluation, typically involving paper-
and-pencil or computer-based tasks that measure verbal fluency, visual confrontation
naming, comprehension, and writing skills, remain limited. These conventional tests often
lack the sensitivity required for early diagnosis and disregard more complex language di-
mensions such as prosody and speech rhythm (suprasegmental features). As a result, even
when these standardized tools detect minor differences between participants with MCI and
healthy older adults, their overall clinical utility is questionable and unreliable [36,42,43]. In
recent years, the application of sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques
has revolutionized the analysis of language skills. By processing written texts, structured
clinical speech, and spontaneous conversation, detailed linguistic features can be auto-
matically extracted to help identify, classify, and describe signs of various psychiatric and
neurological disorders. These computational methods have already proven successful in
detecting the subtle linguistic markers that signal the very early stages of dementia [44–47]
and characterizing associated conditions like AD [25,48–50].
With regard to metrics, research has indicated that “idea density” and “grammatical
complexity” serve as indicators of dementia risk, with lower baseline levels of these measures
linked to the development of dementia [51]. “Idea density”, or “propositional idea density
(P-density)”, refers to the proportion of semantic content words relative to the total number
of words in a sentence [52]. Other linguistic metrics used in connected language studies to
assess semantic content include the ratio of nouns to the total number of pronouns and nouns,
which quantifies “nonspecific language” by identifying pronouns without clear referents [53].
Additionally, connected language analysis has been used to measure grammatical complexity
through verb percentage or verb indices [54] and to assess coherence and informativeness. A
feature taxonomy has been described by de la Fuente Garcia (2020) [55] with regard to the
metrics that have been defined per layer in spontaneous speech production: lexical features,
syntactical features, semantic features, pragmatic features, prosodic features, spectral features,
vocal quality, and ASR-related features.
1.4. Tools to Measure Connected and Spontaneous Speech
Language samples have also been collected through more structured elicitation meth-
ods, such as open-ended questions or semi-structured interviews. For example, participants
have been asked to describe “the happiest moment of their lives” [56] or to respond to
general questions regarding their career, family, life experiences, and hobbies [57,58] in
order to measure spontaneous speech. Other studies of connected speech have utilized
more constrained tasks, such as picture description. While open-ended methods yield
greater linguistic output, they tend to be highly variable across individuals and contexts,
making standardization for comparative analysis challenging. In contrast, picture descrip-
tion tasks offer a structured means of assessment with standardized evaluation measures,
and when the picture remains visible, they place less demand on episodic memory. The

most frequently used picture stimuli in the literature include Norman Rockwell prints,
such as “Easter Morning” [59], and the widely recognized “Cookie Theft” picture from the
Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination [60]. The “Cookie Theft” picture is particularly
notable, as it was designed to encompass elements of a person, time, place, and action
while incorporating vocabulary that is typically acquired early in life [61].
Recent studies have employed various semi-spontaneous speech tasks. For example,
one study protocol used three different prompts such as describing a complex image,
detailing a typical working day, and recounting the last dream remembered [62].
Although there is extensive research on picture description in AD, studies focusing on
this method in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remain comparatively limited. However,
smaller retrospective studies suggest that language decline may emerge in prodromal
phases of the disease [21,38]. Picture description tasks could be valuable in detecting lin-
guistic changes at the MCI or pre-MCI stage, like the SMD group, aiding in early diagnosis
and identifying the optimal time to introduce cognitive–communication interventions.
1.5. Aim of the Review
The purpose of this literature review is to examine methods or tools for assessing
language performance in individuals with SMD. Specifically, it aims to explore quantitative
metrics and indicators of spontaneous speech that may serve as early markers of cognitive
decline. By identifying such speech-based indicators, this review seeks to inform early
diagnosis and help determine the optimal timing for initiating cognitive–communication
interventions for individuals at risk of AD.
Research Questions:
1.
What characteristics of spontaneous speech have been used to detect cognitive decline
in individuals with SMD?
2.
What linguistic metrics are used (e.g., phonological, syntactic, semantic, prag-
matic, etc.)?
3.
What tools or methods are employed to analyze spontaneous and connected speech.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted using two widely recognized databases:
PubMed and Cochrane. The search employed a combination of keywords, subject headings,
and MESH terms related to themes of Subjective Memory Decline and Spontaneous Speech
(detailed in the Supplementary Materials). The initial systematic search took place in
March 2025.
2.2. Procedure, Selection Process, and Data Extraction
This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA Statement guidelines [63].
Following the removal of duplicates, two reviewers (A.N. and M.G) independently screened
articles based on their title, abstract, and relevance. Full-text screening was then performed
for studies deemed potentially eligible. A third reviewer (MG) was involved to resolve
any discrepancies between the initial two reviewers at each stage of the selection process.
The inclusion criteria of the selection process were set as follows: (1) All studies analyzed
spontaneous speech samples in individuals with SMD or individuals with +αβ amyloid.
(2) Studies reported language performance indicators (e.g., lexical, syntactic, semantic,
phonetic, or fluency measures) derived from spontaneous speech. (3) The study population
included participants with SMD based on recognized diagnostic criteria or self-reported
cognitive complaints without objective cognitive impairment. (4) Studies were written in
English. (5) The time frame of studies was 5 years. The exclusion criteria were set as follows:


---

(1) Studies focusing primarily on language markers in populations with MCI, AD, or other
neurodegenerative conditions, without a distinct SMD or +αβ amyloid group. (2) Studies
that assessed language performance using only structured or experimental tasks (e.g.,
naming tests, sentence repetition) without spontaneous speech analysis. (3) Case studies,
reviews, opinion papers, reports, protocols, or meta-analyses. (4) Studies examining speech
and language in psychiatric or neurological conditions unrelated to cognitive decline (e.g.,
aphasia, schizophrenia, stroke).
Any disagreements regarding eligibility criteria were resolved by a third reviewer
(MG). Data extraction was performed independently by MG and SS using a standardized
template that captured the following elements: 1. study/year; 2. methodology; 3. tools;
4. outcome measured; and 5. main findings.
2.3. Data Synthesis Strategy
The synthesis was carried out according to the methodology, the setting/participants,
the tools used, the outcomes measured, and the main findings of the selected studies. These
dimensions were used to interpret the findings and draw conclusions about language
indicators in SCD.
3. Results
The review of the studies selected regarding the target group of SCD provided a full
list of details according to the methodology, tools used, outcomes, and main findings, as
summarized in Table 1.

-
Neuroimaging:
Amyloid and tau PET,

definition, PET and
MRI processing
(1) Audio recordings and
manual transcription of speech
data using the ELAN tool and
CHAT format
(2) PET imaging for amyloid
(PiB) and tau (Flortaucipir)
with FreeSurfer processing
(3) Structural MRI with
FreeSurfer processing
(1) Five speech markers during
delayed recall of a story
memory task: total utterance
time, number of
between-utterance pauses,
speech rate, and percentage of
unique words
(2) The associations between
these speech markers and
global amyloid status and
regional tau signal
The study indicates the following:
-
Speech patterns during delayed recall,
including longer between-utterance
pause time, more between-utterance
pauses, and slower speech rate, were
associated with increased tau PET
signal across medial temporal and
early neocortical regions in
cognitively unimpaired adults
-
These speech markers were not
significantly associated with amyloid
status or delayed recall scores,
suggesting that they capture unique
information about early Alzheimer’s
disease pathology
-
The findings indicate that subtle
changes in speech patterns during
memory recall may reflect early
cognitive impairment associated with
tau pathology, even before overt
clinical symptoms appear

The study indicates the following:
-
A reduction in speech fluency and
pace was observed among

compared to cognitively unimpaired
participants with low
amyloid-β burden
-
The phoneme log-likelihood ratio
(PLLR), a measure of articulatory
precision, was able to effectively
distinguish between cognitively
unimpaired participants with low
amyloid-β burden and those with
MCI or dementia
-
The PLLR was particularly sensitive
in detecting differences between
groups with relatively milder
cognitive declines, suggesting that
alterations in articulatory precision
may be an early marker of
cognitive decline

(3) Extraction of linguistic
parameters from the
transcripts using the T-Scan

software package
(4) Determination of amyloid
status using either amyloid

The primary outcomes
measured in this study were
the associations between
amyloid burden and various
linguistic parameters derived
from spontaneous speech,
including specific words
(content words, concrete
nouns, abstract nouns,
conversation fillers), lexical
complexity (lemma frequency,
Type–Token –Ratio), and
syntactic complexity
(Developmental Level scale)
The study indicates the following:
-
High amyloid burden was modestly
associated with fewer specific words,
particularly in individuals with
higher levels of education, but not
with lexical or syntactic complexity or
performance on conventional
neuropsychological language tests
-
Spontaneous speech recordings may
be a more sensitive way to detect
subtle language changes related to
Alzheimer’s pathology compared to
standard
neuropsychological assessments
van den Berg,

Participants: 490 individuals
with SCD from two cohorts
-
Diagnosis of SCD
based on typical
neurological and
neuropsychological
assessments
-
Annual follow-up
visits over a mean of
4.3 years, with repeated
assessments and
reevaluation
of diagnoses
(1) Semantic and phonemic
verbal fluency tasks
(2) CSF Aβ42 levels and
amyloid PET scans to measure
amyloid burden
(3) Annual neurological and
neuropsychological
assessments to determine
clinical progression from SCD
to MCI or dementia
(1) Semantic fluency score
(2) Phonemic fluency score
(3) semantic–phonemic
discrepancy score
The study indicates the following:
-
Amyloid-positive individuals
showed faster decline in semantic
fluency compared to
amyloid-negative individuals, but no
difference in phonemic fluency
-
Decline in both semantic and
phonemic fluency was associated
with an increased risk of clinical
progression to MCI or dementia.
-
Decline in semantic fluency was an
early indicator of cognitive deficits in
preclinical Alzheimer’s disease

assessment to obtain speech
recordings
(2) The test–retest reliability of
remotely measured acoustic
speech features over multiple

(3) The associations between
remotely measured acoustic
speech features and Aβ
pathology
The study indicates that
-
The remote speech assessment was
feasible and reliable, with high
adherence rates and usability scores
-
Individuals with positive
amyloid-beta (Aβ) status showed
higher pause-to-word ratios in picture
description and journal-prompt
storytelling tasks compared to
Aβ-negative individuals, although
this difference did not remain
significant after correction for
multiple testing
-
The study supports the potential of
remotely measured speech acoustics
as a promising indicator of subtle
cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer’s
disease stages.

2. Transcription error rates
(word error rate and match
error rate) 3. Classification
accuracy of machine learning
models (logistic regression,
Gaussian naive Bayes, and
random forests) in
distinguishing individuals
with AD, MCI, or SMC from
healthy controls
The study indicates that
-
The automatic transcription software
had higher confidence and lower
error rates when transcribing speech
from healthy controls compared to
patients with Alzheimer’s disease,
MCI, or SMC
-
Manually correcting the transcripts,
especially for spontaneous speech
tasks, led to significantly improved
performance of machine learning
models in distinguishing patients
from controls, but manual correction
did not significantly impact model
performance for the reading task
-
Manually adding pauses to the
transcripts did not significantly
improve the performance of the
machine learning models.

Participants: 52 individuals
with normal cognition to mild
dementia performed the
Narrative Description
(ND) test
-
Cognitive function was
assessed for up to
5 years
(1) The Narrative Description
(ND) test and various
linguistic features extracted
from the transcribed Narrative
Descriptions, including word
counts, speech rate, lexical
diversity, and
part-of-speech counts.
The primary outcome
measured in this study was the
ability to perceive, understand,
and describe visual scenes, as
assessed by the Narrative
Description (ND) test.
The study indicates that
-
Many linguistic features were related
to cognitive status and could
distinguish between normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment,
and dementia groups
-
Adding linguistic features to the
Narrative Description test did not
significantly improve its ability to
detect early cognitive impairment or
predict future cognitive decline
compared to the ND test score alone

The study indicates that
-
Automated speech recognition had
high agreement with manual

-
The word count feature was able to
discriminate well between cognitively

counting down task and the verbal
fluency tasks, were particularly useful
for distinguishing between the
different cognitive
impairment groups.

Most of the studies had a cross-sectional design [17,40,55,64,65,67–70], except for
van den Berg (2025) [66] and Reeves (2023) [41], which were longitudinal; Ter Huurne
(2023) [71], which was a prospective cohort study; and Hajjar (2023) [72], which was a
cross-sectional study with a 2-year follow-up.
3.1. Articulatory and Prosodic Markers in Spontaneous Speech
The findings of the current review indicate that articulatory and prosodic features of
spontaneous speech may serve as early indicators of cognitive decline in individuals with
SMD. Specifically, slower speech rate, increased between-utterance pause time, and more
frequent between-utterance pauses during delayed recall tasks have been significantly
associated with elevated tau deposition in medial temporal and early neocortical regions,
even in cognitively unimpaired adults [64]. These speech-based markers appeared to be
independent of amyloid status and traditional delayed recall performance, suggesting their
unique contribution to the early detection of Alzheimer’s pathology [64].
Furthermore, the phoneme log-likelihood ratio (PLLR), a computational measure of
articulatory precision, demonstrated robust discriminatory power between cognitively
unimpaired individuals with low amyloid-β burden and those diagnosed with mild cogni-
tive impairment (MCI) or dementia [65]. The sensitivity of the PLLR to subtle differences
between groups with milder cognitive deficits supports its potential utility as an early
speech-based biomarker of neurodegeneration [65]. Similarly, a reduction in speech fluency
and pace has been observed in individuals with MCI and dementia relative to cogni-
tively unimpaired controls, providing further support for the relevance of temporal and
articulatory markers in characterizing preclinical stages of cognitive impairment [65].
3.2. Lexical–Semantic and Language Content Features
Changes in the lexical and semantic properties of spontaneous speech have also
emerged as potential indicators of early cognitive changes. Amyloid-positive individuals
were found to produce fewer specific content words, particularly among highly educated
participants, despite showing no significant alterations in lexical or syntactic complexity on
conventional neuropsychological assessments [40]. This suggests that spontaneous speech
tasks may offer enhanced sensitivity to detect subtle semantic impairments in preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease. Declines in semantic verbal fluency have been consistently associated
with an increased risk of clinical progression from SMD to MCI or dementia. Notably,
semantic fluency declined more rapidly in amyloid-positive individuals compared to their
amyloid-negative peers, while phonemic fluency remained stable [66]. Furthermore, a
growing discrepancy between semantic and phonemic fluency scores over time has been

linked with subsequent progression to MCI or Alzheimer’s dementia, indicating the clinical
relevance of fluency metrics as longitudinal markers of risk [67].
The diagnostic utility of lexical–semantic and acoustic digital voice biomarkers was
also supported by evidence showing that these features outperformed traditional neuropsy-
chological tests in differentiating MCI from SCD [72]. Lexical–semantic indicators were
able to detect amyloid-β status, while acoustic markers were correlated with hippocampal
volume, reinforcing their biological validity [72]. Additionally, machine learning models
analyzing paralinguistic features from spontaneous speech demonstrated high accuracy
in identifying individuals with MCI and Alzheimer’s disease and predicting performance
in multiple cognitive domains such as memory, executive function, and visuospatial abil-
ity [17].
3.3. Automated Speech Analysis and Remote Assessment Tools
Evidence from the current review supports the feasibility and diagnostic relevance
of remote and automated speech assessments for individuals with SMD. Studies have
shown that automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies exhibit high agreement with
manual transcription for word count metrics, with a 93% probability that discrepancies
remain within minimally important differences [69]. However, qualitative features such as
semantic cluster size and word frequency showed only fair levels of agreement between
automated and manual transcription, indicating current technological limitations in more
complex linguistic analyses [69]. Notably, the diagnostic accuracy of automated speech
features has been demonstrated to differentiate between cognitively unimpaired, SMD,
MCI, and AD groups, particularly when analyzing spontaneous speech and verbal fluency
tasks using mobile applications [70]. The application of these tools is further validated
in studies showing the high classification accuracy and predictive capability of machine
learning models that utilize ASR-derived features from verbal learning and recall tasks [71].
Importantly, the performance of ASR systems is influenced by the clinical status
of participants. Transcripts of speech from cognitively healthy individuals had higher
recognition confidence and lower error rates than those from individuals with SMD, MCI, or
AD. Manual correction of transcripts improved classification performance for spontaneous
speech but had limited effect on reading tasks [68]. Furthermore, the PROSPECT-AD study
highlighted the utility of remote speech-based neurocognitive assessments in identifying
early Alzheimer’s biomarkers. The study emphasized the capacity of such speech features
to correlate with CSF biomarkers such as amyloid-β1-42 and phosphorylated tau, thereby
linking remote speech analysis with established biological measures [69]. High adherence
and usability scores in remote assessments further support the scalability and acceptability
of these tools in preclinical detection settings [67].
In addition, remote protocols, including phone-based and app-based speech eval-
uations, have shown high adherence and user satisfaction among participants, even in
preclinical stages of AD [67]. In particular, tasks such as picture description and narrative
storytelling were successfully administered remotely and demonstrated sensitivity to dif-
ferences in amyloid status [67]. These findings support the integration of speech-based
tools into scalable, accessible cognitive monitoring frameworks, especially for individuals
reporting subjective cognitive complaints.
3.4. Speech vs. Traditional Neuropsychological Testing
Spontaneous speech analysis may offer distinct advantages over conventional neu-
ropsychological assessments, particularly in the context of early or subtle cognitive deficits.
Several studies have shown that linguistic and paralinguistic features extracted from natu-

ral speech can predict disease progression, outperform traditional test scores, and provide
insight into multiple cognitive domains [17,72].
Although automated and speech-based tools may currently be limited in their ability
to capture nuanced qualitative language features with the same reliability as manual
assessments [69], their advantages in ecological validity, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness
are considerable. Furthermore, these tools allow for continuous and remote monitoring,
which is difficult to achieve with conventional testing.
However, challenges remain, as adding linguistic features to standard narrative de-
scription tests did not significantly improve predictive accuracy for future cognitive decline,
suggesting that standalone speech analysis may not always yield additional diagnostic
benefit [41]. Yet, as machine learning methods advance and data quality improves, the
predictive and diagnostic utility of speech biomarkers is likely to grow, reinforcing their
role alongside traditional cognitive assessments.
4. Discussion
The present review findings indicate that speech features—particularly from sponta-
neous and narrative speech—can serve as sensitive indicators of early cognitive changes
due to AD pathology. According to current results, linguistic alterations, particularly in
spontaneous and narrative speech, such as reduced fluency, slower speech rate, increased
pauses, and decreased articulatory precision have been linked to biomarkers like amyloid
and tau, even among asymptomatic individuals like SMD [40,64,65]. These subtle linguistic
changes often emerge before overt clinical symptoms and are detectable through detailed
acoustic and linguistic analysis. Automated speech analysis has emerged as a promising
non-invasive tool for remote screening, early detection, and longitudinal monitoring of
cognitive decline. In addition, with regard to our results, natural language processing
(NLP) and machine learning algorithms enabled the identification of speech patterns that
distinguish normal aging from MCI and various stages of cognitive decline with high
levels of accuracy and specificity [17,70,72]. These technologies offer scalable, cost-effective,
and user-friendly solutions, especially valuable in under-resourced settings or for pop-
ulations with limited access to traditional healthcare services. In contrast, conventional
neuropsychological assessments appear less sensitive to these early linguistic changes, high-
lighting the added value of speech-derived biomarkers in clinical evaluations [40,41,71].
The present study leverages the potential that the performance of spontaneous speech
has for the identification and very early diagnosis of cognitive alterations in older adults.
Moreover, beyond diagnosis through conventional neuropsychological tests of language,
the design and implementation of tasks that elicit spontaneous speech in real contexts have
proven beneficial.
The findings are largely consistent with previous studies, reinforcing the growing
consensus that speech features—particularly those derived from spontaneous and narrative
speech—serve as sensitive early markers of cognitive decline. Our results align with similar
studies [73,74] showing that subtle alterations in fluency, articulation, and speech timing can
be detected even in asymptomatic individuals, such as those with SMD. Notably, automated
speech analysis methods in our included studies, involved NLP and machine learning
approaches, demonstrated high classification accuracy and predictive validity, similar to
the AUC values (0.69–0.92) and accuracy rates (0.70–0.92) reported by similar studies such
as Beltrami et al. (2018) [73] and Eyigoz et al. (2020) [75]. These findings further support
the idea that speech-derived biomarkers outperform conventional language assessments
like the Boston Naming Test [76], especially in identifying early, subtle cognitive changes
that precede clinical impairment.

However, our review expands on the previous literature by emphasizing not only
the diagnostic value of spontaneous speech but also the importance of ecologically valid,
real-context elicitation tasks for capturing linguistic performance in its natural form. While
similar studies [74,77] have acknowledged the role of discourse coherence, lexical re-
trieval, and sentence comprehension as early indicators, our included studies’ findings
highlight the added value of context-sensitive speech tasks that may better reflect day-
to-day communicative challenges in older adults. Furthermore, consistent with prior
work [78], we observed that digital tools not only enhance diagnostic sensitivity but also
offer scalable, low-cost, and user-friendly solutions—a particularly important advantage
for under-resourced settings.
Despite promising findings, several limitations must be addressed in the current re-
view. A key limitation across the included studies lies in their considerable methodological
heterogeneity, which complicates direct comparisons and the generalizability of findings.
Variations in speech tasks (e.g., story recall, picture description, verbal fluency), speech pro-
cessing tools (e.g., ELAN, Praat, WhisperX, OpenSMILE), and linguistic/acoustic features
selected for analysis result in inconsistent outcome measures and interpretations [17,64,65].
Sample characteristics also differ notably across studies with varying diagnostic criteria
and biomarker assessment methods [40,66] (PET vs. CSF) for amyloid. Automated systems
likewise face challenges: although ASR achieves high agreement with manual transcription
for basic metrics like word count, more nuanced features (semantic cluster size, word
frequency, fluency patterns) only show fair concordance [69], potentially undermining
clinical reliability. Furthermore, while some studies apply rigorous manual transcription
and correction [68], others rely on automated methods that may introduce transcription
errors affecting downstream analyses. Many findings rely on small sample sizes or sub-
group analyses [41,72], limiting statistical power, and effect sizes are often modest or lose
significance after correction for multiple comparisons [67]. Finally, although digital voice
markers show promise, their added value over established neuropsychological assess-
ments remains uncertain in several studies [15,41], underscoring the need for longitudinal
validation, harmonized protocols, and real-world clinical integration. Collectively, these
limitations underscore the need for larger, multilingual cohorts, ecologically valid speech
tasks, advanced transcription tools, and models aligned with neuropsychological theory.
5. Conclusions and Future Directions
Spontaneous speech analysis, through acoustic and temporal parameters such as si-
lence duration, phrasal segment length, speech segment frequency, and long pauses, offers
a rich window into the subtle cognitive and linguistic changes that may signal early mem-
ory decline in healthy older adults. These markers, reflecting the natural flow of unscripted
verbal communication, are increasingly recognized for their potential in detecting subjec-
tive memory complaints and early stages of neurodegenerative disorders. Interdisciplinary
research at the intersection of linguistics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI) has
demonstrated that automated tools—especially those based on natural language processing
and machine learning—can effectively capture nuanced speech patterns associated with
early cognitive changes. These changes align with structural and functional brain alter-
ations in memory- and language-related regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex. Future directions include integrating real-time speech analytics with neuroimaging
and digital biomarkers to enhance early screening and monitoring, as well as implementing
multilingual, cross-cultural studies to account for language variability. Such efforts could
provide diverse datasets to train generative AI classification pipelines, leading to the devel-
opment of new speech-based tasks and metrics tailored to detect early cognitive decline

across populations. These directions hold promise for transforming spontaneous speech
into a scalable, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic tool in proactive cognitive health.
