Capacitive deionization, as a second generation electrosorption technique to obtain water, is one of 
the most promising water desalination technologies. Yet; in order to achieve high CDI performance, 
a well-designed structure of the electrode materials is needed, and is in high demand. Here, a novel 
composite nitrogen-TiO2/ZrO2 nanofibers incorporated activated carbon (NACTZ) is synthesized for the 
first time with enhanced desalination efficiency as well as disinfection performance towards brackish 
water. Nitrogen and TiO2/ZrO2 nanofibers are used as the support of activated carbon to improve its low 
capacitance and hydrophobicity, which had dramatically limited its adequacy during the CDI process. 
Importantly, the as-fabricated NACTZ nanocomposite demonstrates enhanced electrochemical 
performance with significant specific capacitance of 691.78 F g−1, low internal resistance and good 
cycling stability. In addition, it offers a high capacitive deionization performance of NACTZ yield with 
electrosorptive capacity of 3.98 mg g−1, and, good antibacterial effects as well. This work will provide an 
effective solution for developing highly performance and low-cost design for CDI electrode materials.
The limited availability of fresh water is one of the prime challenges in the current era, although water is the great-
est widespread substance could be found in the environment1,2. Recently, water has presented a major dilemma 
for the sustainable development of many regions and work industries since increasing socio-economic develop-
ment has brought ever more stringent conflicts between the growing demand for fresh water and reduction in 
supply, in addition to the high proportions of biocontamination. The most straightforward solution to improve 
the quantity, as well as the quality of water, is desalination of salty water source like sea or brackish water, based on 
the generality of Earth’s water being saline3. Several conventional desalination methodologies have been carried 
out to improve the supply of fresh water, the most common of which are reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis and 
thermal distillation4,5. Unfortunately, each of these current methods has experienced problems such as excessive 
operational cost, high energy consumption, and secondary pollution6,7. Investigations into other desalination 
techniques are becoming urgent in order to build economical and sustainable water systems8. Capacitive deion-
ization (CDI) has emerged as an electrosorption desalination technique because of its competence in meeting 
several issues such as low power requirement, non-secondary pollution, inexpensive maintenance and operation, 
eco-friendliness, absence of membrane, and appropriateness for small-scale portable operation9–11. It is worth

mentioning that the concept of CDI is similar to that of energy storage in supercapacitors12. In CDI, a pair of 
electrodes is controlled by a cell voltage (0.8–1.2 V), and meanwhile the potential is applied so that the salt ions 
can be trapped and stored in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) at porous carbon electrodes, which is the 
charging process. After some time, the applied voltage is set to zero or reversed, and ions are flushed out from the 
electrodes to the bulk solution8,13–15.
Hence, on the basis of the above mechanism the desired efficiency of a capacitive deionization depends mainly 
on the electrode performance, so intense research efforts have been funded to develop suitable electrode materi-
als. The key characteristics that are considered as crucial in the electrode material for the production of practical 
CDI should involve high surface area, high conductivity, robust chemical inertia, high capacitance and good 
mechanical strength. Carbonaceous materials with high specific surface area such as graphene16,17, carbon nano-
fibers18–20, carbon aerogels21, carbon nanotubes22, ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)12,23,24, and activated carbon 
(AC)25,26 have been utilized to improve the desalination efficiency, as well as modify the operational conditions. 
Recently, numerous novel electrode materials have been rationally fabricated and employed with several distinct 
features for significantly efficient capacitive deionization, such as nitrogen-doped porous carbon27 and 3D hier-
archical carbon28. However, among these various carbon materials utilized, activated carbon stands out as one of 
the best candidates for electrode material in the CDI process, because of its markedly high surface area, superior 
electrical conductivity and cost-efficiency for scaling-up application29. In spite of the many significant advantages 
of AC, some shortcomings such as limited surface wettability and low specific capacitance additionally constrain 
AC by its limited rate of capability, due to the difficulty in their ion paths resulting in tardy transportation of the 
electrolyte ions during the charge-discharge process30. Consequently, numerous research efforts have focused on 
overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings by hybridizing the EDLC of carbonaceous materials with the 
anchoring of inorganic materials (such as ZnO and SnO2) nanoparticles to elevate the specific capacitance and 
achieve high operating potential31. Specifically, TiO2 and ZrO2 have revealed promise as high efficient electrodes 
for CDI, due to their large electrical conductivity, superior hydrophilic properties, effectiveness in killing some 
microorganisms, and cheapness32,33. In this regard, the combination of TiO2 and ZrO2 is expected to be an effi-
cient electrode of CDI34.
In recent years, nitrogen-doping has been considered one of the most favorable strategies to improve the 
desalination capacity of carbon material35. Compared to carbon, nitrogen-doped carbon has exhibited a sig-
nificant effect with metal oxide because of its extraordinary charge polarization, which results from the differ-
ent electronegativity between nitrogen and carbon, and which leads to superior electron transport properties. 
Additionally, nitrogen-doping could improve the conductivity and electrochemical performance as well as the 
wettability36.
In the present investigation, we demonstrate the following: (1) for the first time, nitrogen doped AC/TiO2 and 
ZrO2 nanofibers (NFs) are introduced as novel electrode materials for the CDI; (2) an effective strategy for fabri-
cating the novel electrode is described, based on morphology and structure, as displayed in Fig. 1. The introduced 
composite has been prepared by using the electrospinning and hydrothermal processes. Electrospinning, as a 
fascinating technique to produce nanofibers with superb performance over the other nanostructures, was utilized 
for the fabrication of ZrO2 incorporated TiO2 NFs by calcination of electrospun mats composed of zirconium

isopropoxyl, titanium isopropoxyl and polyvinyl acetic acid. Afterwards nitrogen and activated carbon were 
introduced to TiO2/ZrO2 by a hydrothermal treatment. The designed electrode configurations exhibit effective 
nitrogen doping and high electrochemical performance.
Results and Discussion
Phase morphology. 
Currently, it is widely known that the electrospinning process has many advantages 
over the other various nanofiber producing techniques, which are attributed to its ability for slurries spinning 
as well as its effectiveness and high yield37. Figure 2 shows the morphology of the synthesized TiO2/ZrO2 NFs 
and the morphology of the NACTZ composite which were investigated by FESEM imagery. Figure 2A shows the 
morphology of the electrospun mat contained entwined zirconium n-propoxyl and titanium iso-propoxyl fibers; 
the obtained nanofibers are smooth, continuous, and bead-free, and ranging from 100 to 600 nm in diameter. 
Figure 2B shows that after the hydrothermal process, the produced nanofibers were not harshly affected, which 
is attributed to the polycondensation tendency of the used metal alkoxides precursors38. However, a few broken 
nanofibers may be observed, but the axial ratio is still large, which reflects the preservation of the main advantage 
of the nanofibrous morphology. Figure 2C shows the SEM imagery of the pristine AC, which reveals a rock-like 
morphology and a heterogeneous and irregular surface. Figure 2D shows the low magnification FESEM imagery 
for NACTZ nanocomposite, while the inset image shows a high magnification. The rough surface of the synthe-
sized NACTZ nanocomposite is evident, as are the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs that are highly dispersed on AC granules, and 
filling the cracks between AC particles without blocking its pores.
To further understand the distribution of the nanofibers along with the activated carbon in the NACTZ nano-
composite, FE-SEM-EDX and TEM mapping analyses were carried out. Figure 3A shows the typical EDX spec-
trum of NACTZ. The analysis displayed the existence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr) 
and nitrogen (N) with the wt% concentrations 84.41, 8.02, 3.94, 0.5 and 3.12, respectively, no other peaks related 
to impurities in the spectrum can be observed, which strongly affirms that the fabricated composite is purely 
made of C, O, Ti, Zr and N. The TEM-mapping analyses Fig. 3(B) show that O, Ti, Zr and N are well dispersed on 
the introduced nanocomposite while carbon (C) is the main element, which also confirms that the nanofibers are 
embedded inside the AC.
XRD was carried out to investigate the crystal phase of the fabricated materials and further prove the suc-
cessful preparation for NACTZ. Figure 4A shows the typical XRD spectrum of AC, TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, ACTZ and 
NACTZ. In the case of AC, two very weak and broad peaks near 26.3° and 42.2° can be observed, which are 
indexed to (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) for the planes of graphite, respectively [JCPDS card no. 41–1487]. For the TiO2/ZrO2 
NFs, diffraction peaks are located at 25.35°, 36.88°, 37.78°, 38.5°, 48.07°, 53.92°, 55.11°, 62.07°, and 62.72°,which 
are attributed to the crystal planes (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (0 0 4), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 1 3) and (2 0 4) for

anatase TiO2 NFs, respectively [JCPDS card no. 00–004–0477]. No peaks for ZrO2 NFs can be observed because 
of its low doping percentage suggesting that ZrO2 NFs are homogeneously dissolved in the crystal structure of 
TiO2 NFs39. On the other hand, the ACTZ and NACTZ nanocomposite clearly reveals the same diffraction peaks 
of TiO2/ZrO2 NFs in addition to a broad peak between 20° and 25° which can be assigned to the (0 0 2) diffraction 
for the graphite crystallites, demonstrating that the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs incorporated successfully into AC. However, 
an observation displays that with nitrogen doping, the XRD peak intensities of anatase has become weaker as 
well as the width of the XRD diffraction peaks of anatase turns into slightly wider, demonstrating the reduce in 
the degree of crystallinity thus the formation of smaller TiO2 crystallites. Consequently, the fabricated NACTZ is 
compared with ACTZ based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM), d-spacing and crystal size according to 
the main peak at (1 0 1). The values of FWHM for NACTZ and ACTZ were calculated using the Scherrer equation 
(0.32 for NACTZ and 0.29 for ACTZ)40. Therefore, the crystal size was decreased from 27.84 nm to 25.05 nm due 
to nitrogen doping which may function as a growth inhibitor41,42.
The specific surface area of the fabricated materials were experimented by N2 adsorption desorption iso-
therms. Figure 4B displays the N2 sorption isotherms in addition to the pore size distribution plots of AC and 
NACTZ. Noticeably, it can be seen that AC displays typical type I isotherm and the hysteresis loop of NACTZ 
demonstrates an identical microporous structure for a carbon-based composite materials for CDI electrode. The 
NACTZ nanocomposite shows the highest specific surface area and the BET was estimated and found to be

3675.47 m2 g−1, whereas the specific surface area for the AC sample was estimated to be 1760 m2 g−1. It should be 
noted that the improvement in the specific surface areas of the NACTZ in comparison with the pristine AC could 
be attributed to the combination between the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs and nitrogen which can improve the porosity of 
NACTZ leading to increase the electrochemical characteristics and capacitive behavior as well.
Figure 5 shows the morphological structure and crystallinity of TiO2/ZrO2 NFs and NACTZ which were 
investigated by TEM measurement. Figure 5A shows the normal TEM imagery for the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs; the diam-
eter of the prepared fiber was calculated and the value is 72.2 nm. Additionally, Fig. 5B shows the HR-TEM 
imagery of the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, which indicates the crystallinity of the sample through describing the atoms 
arrangement within the atomic plane. The lattice fringes of the investigated fiber possess an interplanar spacing 
of 0.361 nm which can be indexed to [1 0 1] plane of anatase TiO2 (the main content of the prepared fiber), which 
is complemented with XRD analysis. Figure 5C depicts the TEM imagery of the pristine AC. It can be seen that 
the surface of AC is rough, thin and shows a flat micro-plates. The TEM imagery for the NACTZ nanocomposite 
(Fig. 5D) reveals that the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs are superficially attached to the activated carbon.
The chemical composition of the as-prepared NACTZ nanocomposite was investigated by X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS), which is considered to be a powerful tool that can be carried out to monitor the changes 
that occurred in the nanocomposite structure. Figure 6A depicts the XPS survey scan of the NACTZ nano-
composite. The XPS scan of the NACTZ revealed the presence of C, O, Ti, Zr and N which highly support and 
complement the TEM elemental mapping results. The Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 6B) show a pair of symmetrical peaks 
that appear at 458.09 and 463.88 eV, which are assigned to Ti 2P3/2 and Ti 2P1/2, respectively. Furthermore, the 
spin-orbital splitting between Ti 2P1/2 and Ti 2P3/2 of 5.79 eV reflects that the obtained Ti (IV) is a normal state 
in the synthesized TiO2/ZrO2 NFs43. From Fig. 6C, the XPS of Zr 3d5/2 electrons depicts the presence of peak at 
181.46 eV which is consistent with the value reported for Zr (+IV) ions in the Zr-doped TiO2
44. Additionally, the 
survey scan of NACTZ nanocomposite indicates the existence of N 1 s peak. The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 6D) of the 
NACTZ was fitted into one peak at binding energy of 399.6 eV, which is assigned to the pyridinic N (N-6)45. This 
offers a solid proof that the NACTZ nanocomposite was successfully doped by nitrogen atoms. It is worth noting 
that the existence of pyridinic N (N-6) has advantages for CDI, such as increasing the pseudocapacitance and the 
wettability as well as improving the ion diffusion and transportation46.
Figure 7 shows the FTIR spectrum, which was carried out to investigate the structural features of the AC, 
TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, and the significant changes that were observed in NACTZ after their interaction. The FTIR 
spectra of the AC show peaks at 1129 cm−1 (C‒O stretching vibration)47, 1560 cm−1 (C = C bonding in aromatic 
carbons)48 and 3324 cm−1 (OH group)49. On the other side, the vibration band at 465–672 cm−1 in the TiO2/ZrO2 
NFs was attributed to a Ti–O vibration and the bands at 3443, 2887, 2334 and 1631 cm−1 were assigned to O–H 
bending of the absorbed water molecules, C–H stretch, O = C = O and C = C (skeletal vibration of unoxidized 
graphitic domains), respectively50,51. In the case of the FTIR spectra of the NACTZ, the existence of all the peaks 
corresponding to TiO2/ZrO2 NFs can be seen, but with small shifting of peak positions that occurred, which is 
attributed to the interaction between TiO2/ZrO2 NFs and activated carbon. NACTZ has a characteristic band 
at about 538 cm−1 that can be assigned to Ti–O vibration and the characteristic peaks around 2882 cm−1 and 
2338 cm−1 correspond to the C–H stretch and O = C = O. Meanwhile, the broad band at 3430 cm−1 was related to 
either ‒OH and/or ‒NH moieties that were detected as well as the band at 1190 cm−1 corresponding to the C–N 
stretching, suggesting that nitrogen atoms are incorporated into activated carbon and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs52,53.
Surface wettability test. 
It is well known that the surface wettability is a key factor for increasing the 
electrode adsorption capacity. Whereas, the main dilemma for all carbon electrodes, including activated carbon, 
is their low surface wettability based on their hydrophobicity. Herein, the activated carbon was by doping with 
TiO2/ZrO2 NFs and nitrogen to enhance the hydrophilicity of the AC electrode as well as the wettability. The 
hydrophilic characteristics of the doped and un-doped electrodes, which were provided by measurement of the 
static water contact angles at the synthesized electrode surface as shown in Fig. 8. Doping the electrode signifi-
cantly enhanced the surface wettability of AC, the corresponding contact angle of the pristine AC was about 148°

(Fig. 8A). In contrast, Fig. 8B shows that the AC electrode doped by TiO2/ZrO2 NFs revealed highly hydrophilic 
performance with 16.9° water contact angle. Consequently, after doping the AC by nitrogen and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, 
the electrode demonstrates extremely higher hydrophilic property than AC and ACTZ electrodes, the entire con-
tact angle of NACTZ electrode reaching to 3° (Fig. 8C).
Electrochemical behavior. 
The electrochemical measurements for the fabricated electrodes were carried 
out in a NaCl aqueous solution to investigate the influence of nitrogen and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs on AC. Figure 9A 
reveals the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, AC, ACTZ and NACTZ electrodes in 1 M 
NaCl at 10 mV s−1. It can be observed that the all CV curves almost exhibits a quasi-rectangular shape, besides 
the absence of faradic peaks in the working potential of −0.4 to 0.6 V, suggesting that the capacitive behavior be 
attributed to the electric double-layer formation because of the coulombic interactions instead of redox reac-
tions54. Moreover, the curves reveal a good symmetry, indicating a quite reversible capacitive performance55. 
Obviously, the NACTZ electrode demonstrates greater improvement in electrochemical performance compared 
to TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, AC and ACTZ electrodes which is attributed to the co-doping of nitrogen and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs 
which improved the hydrophilicity and the surface wettability of NACTZ as well as the porous nature resulting in 
the enhancement of the speed up of the ion transfer into the electrolyte to achieve the electric double-layer prop-
erty37. The CV humps of the NACTZ electrode at different sweep rates are shown in Fig. 9(B). It can be seen that 
when the scan rate increases for NACTZ electrode the CV curves converted gradually from rectangular shape to 
leaf-like shape according to the inherent resistivity resulting from the salt solution, additionally it cannot be seen a 
redox peaks suggesting a significant capacitive behavior of NACTZ as CDI electrode material. Figure 9C displays 
the CV curves for NACTZ at NaCl in different concentrations. Clearly, the specific capacitances increased when 
the concentration of NaCl increased reflecting excellent electrosorption capacity in addition to hard saturation.
Figure 10A, compares the specific capacitance of TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, AC, ACTZ and NACTZ electrodes which 
is calculated according to Eq. (1) at various scan rates. It is important to note that the area under the CV curve

of NACTZ electrode is much larger in comparison with those of TiO2/ZrO2 NFs, AC and ACTZ, suggesting the 
higher specific capacitance of the NACTZ electrode. It can be seen the obvious decay in specific capacitance at 
high scan rates, and vice versa the increased of specific capacitance at low scan rates. This finding occurs, because 
at low scan rates, the ions obtain adequate time to transport into the NACTZ composite, resulting in the extreme 
ions migration reaction becoming possible, thus leading to distinct capacitive behavior at low scan rates, com-
pared to the high scan rates. Apparently, the NACTZ electrode permanently exhibits the highest value at any 
selected sweep rate compared with the other electrodes. Therefore, NACTZ could be fabricated and used as a con-
ductive electrode for the capacitive deionization process. The specific capacitance at 10 mV s−1 of the NACTZ elec-
trode is 691.78 F g−1, which is much higher than those of ACTZ (251.32 F g−1), AC (207.46 F g−1) and TiO2/ZrO2 
NFs (0.4 F g−1). Comprehensively, the enhancements in specific capacitances are essentially according to the 
co-doping of nitrogen and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs bringing: (i) increased charge transfer; (ii) improved specific surface

area thus the pore volume; and (iii) enhance the hydrophilicity and electronic conductivity56. As displayed in 
Fig. 10B the greatly interest finding achieved in this study; that the NACTZ electrode could be successfully used 
for water desalination because the salt removal exceeds the threshold of seawater concentration.
EIS measurements were employed to investigate the electrical conductivity of the fabricated electrodes. 
Figure 10C introduces the EIS of AC, ACTZ and NACTZ electrodes in 1 M NaCl solution. The Nyquist profiles 
exhibiting that all synthesized electrode materials possess the same shapes, involving a quasi-semicircle in the 
high frequency region as well as a nearly vertical line in the low frequency region. The intersection at the real axis 
(Z′) indexed to the equivalent series resistance (ESR), whereas the width of the semicircle refers to the charge 
transfer resistance (Rct) and double-layer capacitance (Cdl)57. It can be seen, according to the diameter of the 
semicircle that the Rct of NACTZ is much lower than those of AC and ACTZ, reflecting the enhancement in the 
charge transfer ability of NACTZ. This also matches the CV results and the specific capacitance value of NACTZ 
being the highest. Moreover, it can be claimed that the capacitive behavior of carbon-based electrodes could be 
improved by nitrogen doping.
The cycle characteristic of the NACTZ nanocomposite was also tested by utilizing the continuous GC meas-
urement in 1 M NaCl aqueous solution through a 0.1 A g−1 current density. It can be seen in Fig. 10D, that the

profile exhibits a triangular shape with linear lines, suggesting that the capacitive behavior occurs according to the 
formation of electrical double-layer rather than Faradaic reaction58. Additionally, no observed charge/discharge 
decay over 50 cycles, reflecting a high reversibility and cyclability for the NACTZ electrode. These important 
feature point to a long service life for the NACTZ electrode in CDI process.
CDI behavior. 
The deionization efficiency of the synthesized electrodes was plotted in Fig. 11, in NaCl aque-
ous solution having an initial concentration of ~100 μS cm–1 through a constant operational voltage of 1.2 V. It can 
be clearly seen that once the electric field is applied the solution conductivity at the early stage starts to quickly 
decrease, implying the fast transportation of the salt ions. Afterwards, the change in solution conductivity persis-
tently attenuates until reaching adsorption equilibrium, because of the electrodes becoming saturated as well as 
the electrostatic repulsion occurring between the electrode and electrolyte ions. Clearly, the NACTZ nanocom-
posite electrode demonstrates the largest adsorption capacity in comparison to ACTZ, AC and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs.

According to Eq. (2), the salt removal efficiencies (η) of AC, ACTZ, and NACTZ electrodes are 25.44, 53.08 and 
71.19%, respectively. As expected, NACTZ exhibits the best salt removal efficiency. It should be noted that when 
the saturation time increased the adsorption of ions increased on the surface of the electrode. Hence, according 
to Eq. (3) the electrosorptive capacity of the NACTZ is estimated to be 3.98 mg/g which shows a remarkable 
improvement in comparison to ACTZ (2.96 mg/g), the pristine AC (1.4 mg/g) and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs (0.067 mg/g). 
Thus, the desalination performance could be ordered as: NACTZ > ACTZ > AC > TiO2/ZrO2 NFs. The NACTZ 
nanocomposite exhibiting the highest desalination performance can be attributed to: (1) the nitrogen doping 
enhancibg the specific surface area and that can influence the adsorption of ions by providing more sites; (2) 
highly hydrophilic performance; (3) reduced the expulsion of co-ion; (4) and its concentration polarization is low.
Our strategy through this work was not only to obtain the requirements needed for CDI electrode materials 
and enhanced the desalination performance but also demonstrates a high competence for effective disinfection 
via fabricating the CDI electrode with materials having high antimicrobial activity. In order to evaluate the anti-
bacterial performance of the pristine AC and NACTZ against E. coli and S. aureus, spectrophotometric analysis 
was recorded. As displayed in Fig. 12A and B, shows that the pristine AC, does not demonstrate any considerable 
efficiency in its antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive or further Gram-negative bacteria. On the other side, 
in comparison with AC, the NACTZ nanocomposite exhibits a robust antibacterial performance and high killing 
efficiency towards E. coli and S. aureus in spite of the high injection of bacteria concentration being 107 CFU 
mL−1. As postulated, NACTZ electrode exhibits the highest antimicrobial performance, which could be assigned 
to the TiO2 and ZrO2-doping which both possess a robust antibacterial activity towards a broad spectrum of 
bacteria38,59. TiO2 and ZrO2 have the ability for killing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, despite the 
lowest sensitivity of Gram-positive bacteria according to their capability for the formation of spores60. Moreover, 
the antibacterial activity for TiO2 is widely known, which is attributed to its ability to produce the reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), specifically the formation of hydroxyl free radicals as well as peroxide within UV-A irradiation61. 
Additionally, it is recently reported that nano-sized TiO2 has the ability for killing several viruses such as hepatitis 
B virus62, MS2 bacteriophage63 and Herpes simplex virus64. Therefore, it can be claimed that the NACTZ nano-
composite is a promising candidate as disinfectant for water.
In summary, Table 1 lists the reported data on the specific capacitance and electrosorption capacity for dif-
ferent carbon-based electrodes, to further prove that NACTZ is beneficial to improving the CDI performance.
Conclusions
NACTZ is rationally designed and obtained by two steps: an electrospinning technique followed by a hydro-
thermal treatment and then utilized as CDI electrode material for the first time. TiO2/ZrO2 NFs incorporation

and nitrogen doping strongly improved the performance of the pristine activated carbon in the CDI process. 
Impressively, with respect to the most important parameters that could achieve high desalination behavior, 
wettability, specific capacitance and electrosorption capacity, the NACTZ hybrid networks demonstrates high 
hydrophilicity with lower contact angle of 3°, large specific capacitance of 691.78 F g−1, and increased electrosor-
potive capacity of 3.98 mg g−1. Additionally, the NACTZ nanocomposite demonstrates high disinfection capacity 
against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is postulated that the introduction of TiO2/ZrO2 NFs and N 
co-doped AC will not only open new avenue for promising way to create a novel high performance CDI electrode 
materials, but may also open opportunities to be applied for energy and electrochemistry application.
Experimental
Materials. 
Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (>97%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%, Sigma-
Aldrich), zirconium(IV) isopropoxide (Zr(Iso)) solution 70 wt% in 1-propanol Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4(Sigma-Aldrich), 
poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc, M.wt = 500,000 g/mol), and glacial acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), Activated carbon powder 
(CEP-21K, PCT Co., Korea, BET surface area = 2110 m2 g−1) and urea (Alfa Aesar) were obtained.
Synthesis of Zr-doped TiO2 nanofibers (TiO2/ZrO2 NFs). 
A sol–gel composed of Ti(Iso), Zr(Iso) and 
PVAc was prepared as follows: (titanium (Iso); 3.6 g and Zirconium (Iso); 0.28 g) was added to PVAc (14 wt.%, 
in DMF) solution, and then a few drops of CH3COOH acid were added until the solution became clear and get 
see-through. The solution was continuous mixed under stirred conditions for two hours. The achieved sol–gel 
was supplied to the electrospinning process at a high voltage of 18 kV using DC power supply (CPS-60 K02V1, 
Chung EMT Co., South Korea) at room temperature with 60% relative humidity. The distance was kept constant 
at 15 cm between tip and rotating cylinder. The ready electrospun nanofibers were collected then vacuously dried 
under vacuum for one day at 60 °C. After that, the nanofibers were calcined in air atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h at 
the rate of 5 °C/min.
Fabrication of nitrogen-doped activated carbon incorporated TiO2/ZrO2 NFs (NACTZ). 
The 
prepared TiO2/ZrO2 NFs (0.06 g) were stirred and sonicated for 1 h in 100 ml de-ionized water under magnetic 
stirring, then a mix of 0.5 g amount of activated carbon and 0.5 g amount of urea was added to the solution, 
which has kept sonicated for 30 min. Later, the dispersed solution was subjected to the hydrothermal process in 
a Teflon-lined autoclave at 120 °C for 24 h. Finally, the solution was filtered and washed five times with distilled 
water and dried at 70 °C under vacuum oven. Activated carbon incorporated TiO2/ZrO2 NFs (ACTZ) was fabri-
cated by the same strategy in urea-free solution.
Characterization. 
The crystallinity was studied by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα 
(λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation over Bragg angle 2θ ranging from 10° to100°. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy anal-
ysis (XPS) (AXIS-NOVA, Kratos analytical Ltd., UK) was conducted to investigate the elemental and chemical 
compositions of the prepared material. The surface morphology of the samples was investigated via field emission 
transmission electron microscopy (FESEM) (FE-SEM; JEOL JEM-2200 FS, Japan). The particle sizes and shapes 
were examined through high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), scanning TEM (STEM) 
with elemental mapping and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (JEM-2200 FS, JEOL Ltd., Japan). The specific sur-
face areas of the introduced materials, were estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method of nitrogen 
sorption at 77 K by utilizing a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra 
of the samples were investigated with Spectrum 100 FT-IR, PerkinElmer, USA. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) exper-
iments were tested by utilizing a VersaStat4 potentiostat instrument, as reported previously in our work32. The 
specific capacity can be calculated by integrating the full CV cycle to determine the average value according to 
the following relationship65:

where, Cs is the specific capacitance (Fg−1), i is the response current (A), V is the potential (V), υ is the potential 
scan rate (Vs−1), and m is the mass of the electro-active materials in the electrode (g).
Electrosorptive capacity measurement. 
The CDI electrodes were prepared as follows: the fabricated 
active materials and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder were mixed in a weight ratio of 80:20 (active mate-
rials: PTFE) to investigate the electrosorptive capacity for the CDI system via the introduced carbon material. 
Each working electrode was then drop-casted by the mixed slurry on the carbon electrode, then subjected to a 
vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 hours. The CDI electrode was obtained in a geometric surface of 40 mg/cm2. The 
salt removal efficiency (η) and electrosorptive capacity (Sc) of the electrode can be calculated according to the 
following equations66:

Antibacterial activity measurement. 
The antibacterial performance of N-AC/TZ nanocomposite was 
quantitatively evaluated on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria utilized in this work 
were Escherichia coli (ATCC 52922) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29231) as model organisms. The anti-
bacterial properties of fabricated materials against each strain were determined by spectrophotometric method 
as described in ref.67.
