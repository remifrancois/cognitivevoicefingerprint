Abstract. There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Some studies have focused
on pause production, revealing that patients make extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been attributed to lexical
retrieval difﬁculties, but pausing may also reﬂect other forms of cognitive impairment as it increases with cognitive load. The
aim of the present study was to analyze autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective, looking at
pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our ﬁrst objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of these
changes. Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD and 15 matched cognitively normal controls underwent an ecological episodic
memory task, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. Autobiographical discourse collected
from the ecological episodic memory task was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup comparisons
showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than controls overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses.
The number of these speciﬁc pauses was positively correlated with patients’ episodic memory performance. Furthermore,
neuroimaging analysis showed that, in the patient group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar area (BA 10) grey
matter density. This region may therefore play an important role in the planning of autobiographical discourse production. These
ﬁndings demonstrate that pauses in early AD may reﬂect a compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel and
memory retrieval.

of cognitive impairment may also be present, even in
the early stages of the disease [1, 2]. Language difﬁ-
culty is one of the deﬁcits that are frequently reported
in patients. Research has shown that lexical-semantic
deﬁcits can occur in the very earliest stage of AD.
These deﬁcits have been observed in ﬂuency [3], nam-
ing [4, 5], and semantic tasks [5, 6]. More and more
studies have been focusing on discourse production in
AD, with a view to assessing the functional use of lan-
guage and cognition. In the present study, we sought
to examine both memory and language impairment,
through patients’ autobiographical discourse.
Studies analyzing discourse in AD have shown that
standardized tasks cannot capture the full extent of
patients’ lexical-semantic impairment. Some of these
studies used description tasks, such as the Cookie Theft
picture [7], which highlighted a reduction in semantic
content [8, 9], a decrease in syntactic complexity [8],
and an increase in word-ﬁnding difﬁculty, sometimes
reﬂected in pausing [9]. Others used topic-directed
interviews, which revealed decreased coherence [10,
11] and, in a few cases, pragmatic impairment [12].
Finally, some authors focused on autobiographical dis-
course, asking patients to talk about important events
in their lives. Gayraud et al. [13], for instance, observed
that patients with AD used words with a higher lexical
frequency, made more pauses, and had more difﬁculty
ﬁnding words and less efﬁcient speech. Hoffmann
et al. [14] also found that speech efﬁciency gradually
decreased as the disease progressed, owing to greater
hesitationduringspeech.Fortheirpart,Singhetal.[15]
reported that patients with AD produced longer pauses
than healthy participants. In other words, patients
seemed to make a different use of pauses during auto-
biographical discourse, which the authors attributed
to lexical retrieval difﬁculties. Other authors have
stressed the point that discourse production involves
other cognitive abilities besides lexical-semantic ones,
including memory [16] and executive functions [17].
It is therefore possible that pauses observed during dis-
course reﬂect not only lexical retrieval difﬁculties, but
also other cognitive processes.
Pauses are composite events. They can be divided
into two major types: silent pauses, deﬁned as “the
perception of a silent portion in the speech signal” [18]
and ﬁlled pauses, which “mark a hesitation on the part
of the speaker” [19]. The number, type, and duration of
pauses during discourse are governed by physiological
constraints [18], but can also reﬂect cognitive pro-
cesses. Pauses may indicate lexical decision-making.
For example, when participants are asked to guess
each successive word in an utterance, less predictable
words are preceded by longer pauses [20]. They also
reﬂect cognitive load, and increase when the talk-
ing point is unfamiliar [21] or more abstract [22].
Apart from their type, pauses can also be distin-
guished according to their location in the discourse.
In Goldman-Eisler’s typology, pauses at natural punc-
tuation points are deﬁned as grammatical pauses.
Outside these grammatical junctures, they are labeled
as non-grammatical [20]. Some authors have shown
that pausing is most likely to occur at the beginning
of an utterance and before longer utterances, where
the cognitive load is higher (for a review, see [19]).
Theseresultssuggestthatgrammaticalpausesaremore
due to cognitive planning than non-grammatical ones.
Examining articulatory characteristics at and around
pauses, Ramanarayanan et al. [23] showed that non-
grammatical pauses are unplanned during discourse,
whereas grammatical ones belong to a higher cognitive
plane.
Studies analyzing pauses in AD [13–15, 24] have
been characterized by considerable methodological
variability, in terms of the types of pauses that are
analyzed (silent, ﬁlled, or both), the pause threshold
(ranging from 200 ms to 2 s), the population under
scrutiny (ranging from mild cognitive impairment
(MCI)tothemostadvancedstage),andthetasksthatare
used, which include autobiographical discourse [13],
story re-telling [24], and interviews [15]. Moreover,
withonenotableexception[13],theyhaveneverfocused
onthelocationofthepauses.Inthepresentstudy,weset
out to speciﬁcally analyze the pattern of pause use.
Another relevant way of considering patients’ difﬁ-
culties is to analyze discourse production together with
concurrent cognitive and anatomical changes. As far as
we know, this kind of analysis has already been under-
taken in several neurological disorders (frontotemporal
lobar degeneration [25], Lewy body spectrum disor-
ders [26], primary progressive aphasia [27]), but not
in AD. Authors who have done this have found that
ﬂuency (speech rate and between-utterance pauses) is
correlated with the frontopolar area (Brodmann area
(BA) 10). This region plays a critical role in higher-
order cognitive functions, including memory retrieval
[28], prospective memory [29], multitasking [30], rea-
soning [31], and theory of mind [30]. Considering
all these different results together, Burgess et al. [32]
came up with a gateway hypothesis for BA 10, pos-
tulating that this area supports mechanisms involved
in switching attention between external representa-
tions (i.e., cognition provoked by or oriented toward
an external stimulus) and self-generated internal repre-
sentations (i.e., stimulus-independent thoughts). This

area therefore seems crucial for autobiographical dis-
course production.
In the present study, we set out to analyze pauses
during the autobiographical discourse of patients with
MCI due to AD and cognitively normal controls. We
adopted a new procedure, whereby episodic memory is
probed in a situation as close as possible to real life, all
the while being controlled (similar to protocols already
published [33, 34]), in order to achieve a suitable
approximation of the real-life discourse impairment.
This procedure was based on real-life mini-events. We
investigated the production and location of pauses dur-
ing this speciﬁc type of discourse, and also conducted
full neuropsychological assessments and structural
MRI scans. We predicted that patients would produce
more pauses than controls during the autobiographical
narratives, and that between-utterance pauses would
be related to memory retrieval processes rather than to
lexical retrieval. We also thought that BA 10 might be
involved in switching attention between the events that
participants had experienced and the current recall sit-
uation, and that between-utterance pauses might reﬂect
this switching.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
All participants gave their informed consent. This
study was approved by the local ethics committee
(Comit´e de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et
Outre-Mer I) and the French Agency for the Safety
and Security of Medical Devices (Agence Franc¸aise de
S´ecurit´e Sanitaire des Produits de Sant´e, A90605-58).
We recruited 15 patients aged over 65 years with a
diagnosis of MCI due to AD [1, 35]. They all came
from the outpatient memory clinic of the Neurology
Department of Toulouse University Hospital (France).
A total of 15 matched cognitively normal participants
were recruited, either among the patients’ relatives or
via posters in public places.
Pre-inclusion assessment
Patients were invited to enroll in the study if they
presented with a memory complaint that had lasted at
least 6 months, had no concomitant history of neuro-
logical or psychiatric disease, and were not affected by
any clinically signiﬁcant pathology that might explain
their memory complaint. Patients then underwent the
following:
Pre-inclusion
neuropsychological
assessment:
Autonomy in daily life was assessed using the Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR [36]) scale. Anterograde
verbal memory was assessed using the Free and Cued
Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT [37]).
Brain MRI: This was performed for all participants,
using a Philips 3T Intera Achieva (Philips, Best, The
Netherlands).3DT1-andT2-weightedsequenceswere
obtained. The T2-weighted images were examined by
a neuroradiologist with extensive experience and blind
to the clinical data, who rated them for white-matter
changes using on the Fazekas and Schmitt (F&S) scale
[38].
Amyloid assessment: This was performed using either
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) analysis and/or amyloid
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.
CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture.
CSF biomarker levels of total tau (T-Tau), phospho-
tau (P-Tau), A42, and A40 were measured using an
ELISA method (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium). We cal-
culated the Innotest Amyloid Tau Index (IATI). P-Tau
≥60 pg/mL and IATI ≤0.8 were deemed to be sugges-
tive of AD [39]. In the case of an ambiguous proﬁle
(P-Tau <60 pg/mL or IATI >0.8), we calculated the
A42/A40 ratio, and a score <0.045 was taken to be
compatible with a diagnosis of AD [40].
Florbetapir (AV-45) PET scan: Cerebral emission
scan acquisitions began 50 min after an injection of
3.7 MBq/kg of AV-45, and lasted 10 min. Images were
visually analyzed by two trained nuclear medicine,
who rated each image as amyloid positive or negative
[41, 42].
Healthy controls underwent exactly the same neu-
ropsychological assessments and MRI scans as the
patients.
Inclusion criteria
Following the pre-inclusion assessment, patients
were included in the present study if they met the fol-
lowing criteria for MCI due to AD [1, 35]: CDR ≤0.5,
sum of the three free recalls ≤17/48 and/or sum of
the three free and cued recalls ≤40/48 in the FCSRT
[43], and evidence of amyloid pathology in CSF [39]
and/or positive AV-45 PET imaging [41, 42]. Patients
with signiﬁcant white-matter T2 hyperintensities (F&S
score >2) or with clinically signiﬁcant lesions were
excluded.
Cognitively normal individuals were included if
they had no memory complaint, no history of

neurological or psychiatric disease, and no ﬁrst-degree
relatives with AD. They were excluded if they had
signiﬁcant white-matter hyperintensities on their T2-
weighted MR images (F&S score >2) or if either the
pre- or post-inclusion neuropsychological assessment
revealed cognitive impairment (test scores >2 standard
deviations (SDs) below the norm).
Post-inclusion assessment
Standard neuropsychological assessment
All participants underwent a comprehensive neu-
ropsychological assessment. Visual memory was
tested with the immediate and delayed recall condi-
tions of the Rey–Osterrieth complex ﬁgure [44] and the
DMS48 visual recognition memory task [45]. Seman-
tic memory was explored with the Information subtest
of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III)
[46] and the TOP12 test assessing semantic memory
about the lives of 12 celebrities from their faces [47].
Working memory was probed with the WAIS-III Digit
Span subtest, and attention with the Symbol Digit sub-
testoftheWAIS-III.Executivefunctionswereassessed
with the Trail Making Test B [48] and the Frontal
Assessment Battery [49]. Language was assessed with
the phonological (letter p) and categorical (animals)
ﬂuency tests [50] and the picture-naming task (DO80)
[51], while other tests probed visuospatial abilities
(copyoftheRey–Osterriethcomplexﬁgure)andvisuo-
perceptive abilities (Benton Facial Recognition Test
[52]). Anxiety and depression were also measured,
usingtheState-AnxietyInventory(Y-Aform;[53])and
the Beck Depression Inventory [54].
Ecological memory assessment
Epitoul is an innovative and ecological test of
anterograde autobiographical episodic memory. Usual
neuropsychological assessment takes place in the same
roomandwithinarelativelyshortperiodoftime,which
limits rich multi-modal context that usually charac-
terizes events stored in episodic memory. Overall,
personal involvement of subjects during neuropsy-
chological assessment is minimal since the subject
is not a direct actor of what is going on. Interest-
ingly, the use of other procedures based on real-world
[33, 55] tasks appeared relevant to investigate memory
impairment and even more sensitive than laboratory
setting to detect subtle deﬁcits [34]. Likewise, Epitoul
is based on a “real life” experience in which subjects
are living 8 stereotyped mini-events within the facil-
ities of the hospital with an implicit encoding. The
8 mini-events are identiﬁed and considered as strik-
ing, contextualized, and checked, always taking in the
same order and in the same places (Supplementary
Table 1). The learning of this test is incidental. He
knows only that he participates in a neuropsychologi-
cal investigation, but that this one will be made more
later during the day. The whole session lasted about 25
minutes.
After a 20-minute interval, participants were asked
to recall the mini-events they had experienced: “I
would like you to chronologically recall everything we
did between the moment we met and the moment we
returned to the ofﬁce. You must try to recall this episode
for me in the greatest possible detail, as though you
were reliving it, in the order of the real-life events:
what we did, what we saw, where we went, the circum-
stances and any events that occurred, what you felt or
thought. I’m listening to you.”
When they had completed their oral descriptions, the
experimenteraskedthemtolookbackovertheitinerary
and try to think of more details. Further to the free
reminder, they were asked open questions about each
of the eight real-life events: “Very well. Do you have
anything to add? I’m going to give you some informa-
tion that will help you remember more details about
this event”.
The experimenter only asked questions about ele-
ments that had not been supplied by the participant
during the free recall. Other questions are evaluated
with the maximum of points.
Recall responses were taped with a digital recorder
and assessed by two experimenters. Each mini-event
was rated on a 4-point scale for both the free and the
cued recall. The maximum score for each type of recall
was therefore 32. (The scoring grid is available in Sup-
plementary Table 2.)
All assessments and imaging examinations, from
pre-inclusion to post-inclusion, were performed within
three months.
Autobiographical discourse analysis
The spontaneous discourses produced during the
free recall component of the Epitoul test formed the
core of the present study. We focused our analysis on
pauses. Discourse analyses were limited to no more
than three prompts from the experimenter.
Transcribing and coding
Participants’ oral productions were manually and
orthographically transcribed with the Child Language
Data Exchange System (CHILDES; MacWhinney,
2011), using the embedded Computerized Lan-
guage Analysis (CLAN) software program and its

CHAT transcription norms. This system automatically
extracts quantitative data (i.e., number of each type
of pauses). For the purpose of the analysis, utterances
were annotated while listening to the recording (i.e.,
falling intonations for declarative utterances and rising
ones for questions).
Pause analysis
Pause type and length were manually tagged with
Audacity software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/),
using a 250-ms threshold [20]. This cut-off point of
250 ms was chosen to differentiate articulatory pauses
from hesitation ones [20]. We included both silent and
ﬁlled pauses in our analysis (in the following exam-
ples, pauses are indicated by the sign //). Regarding
the location of these pauses, we began by distin-
guishing between-utterance pauses (e.g., “you went
to the other side. // you bought the newspaper. // you
talked about chocolate”) from within-utterance pauses
(e.g., “we walked // a short time”). We were partic-
ularly interested in this distinction, as the beginning
of an utterance is assumed to be the most cogni-
tively demanding [19, 20], and between-utterance
pauses therefore presumably reﬂect planning for the
upcoming thought more than other pauses do. The
case has already been made for drawing this distinc-
tion when analyzing the narratives of patients with
AD [15].
For within-utterance pauses, we followed Goldman-
Eisler’s typology. We annotated grammatical pauses,
that is, those occurring at natural punctuation junc-
tures (e.g., “in the ﬁrst building // or another one”). We
also annotated non-grammatical pauses, that is, those
produced outside these grammatical junctures, in the
middle or toward the end of a phrase (e.g., “we bought
a // newspaper”), between repeated words and phrases
(e.g., “then // then we went outside”), in the middle of
a verbal compound (e.g., “I have // taken”), or in a false
start or reconsideration (e.g., “we walked to // you did
it on purpose?”).
To sum up, we annotated between-utterance pauses
and within-utterance pauses (both grammatical and
non-grammatical), as shown in the following example
taken from a patient’s free recall (parentheses indicate
pause type and length in seconds):
“We went to the secretary’s ofﬁce. (between-
utterance: 1.710) there was a (within-utterance
non-grammatical: 0.566) nobody there. (between-
utterance: 0.487) then we crossed the corridor.
(between-utterance:1.066)wewentintoaroomjustthe
two of us (within-utterance grammatical: 0.355) and
you hmm (within-utterance non-grammatical: 0.447)
asked me today’s date (within-utterance grammatical:
0.682) I remember that.”
Variables
The following variables were used to analyze the
discourse of the patients and cognitively normal
controls:
• Discourse organization: total number of words
in the narrative, total number and mean length
of pauses, total speech duration, speech rate and
pause rate per 100 words;
• Pause use: between-utterance, within-utterance
grammatical and within-utterance non-gram-
matical pause rates per 100 words; percentages of
between-utterancepauses,within-utterancegram-
matical
pauses
and
within-utterance
non-
grammatical pauses.
Statistical analysis
Behavioral data
All the statistical analyses were performed using the
Statistica software package, Version 8 (StatSoft, 2007).
Intergroup comparisons: Because of the small sample
sizes, we used a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test
to study differences between groups. P values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons according to Holm’s
stepdown procedure (Holm, 1979). The size effect was
assessed using Cohen’s d.
Correlations between the EPITOUL ecological task
and standardized memory tasks: Spearman’s rank
correlation test was used to assess the strength of cor-
relations in the patient group between the Epitoul cued
recall scores and the sum of the three free and cued
recalls on the FCSRT, the Rey ﬁgure and the DMS48
Set 2.
Correlations between pausing and cognitive abili-
ties: Spearman’s rank correlation test was used to
assess the association between behavioral perfor-
mance and neuropsychological performance in the
shape of anterograde episodic memory (Epitoul cued
recall; sum of the three free and cued recalls on
the FCSRT) and lexical-semantic aspects of language
(picture-naming and semantic ﬂuency tasks). Corre-
lations were calculated separately for each group. As
all correlations were motivated by a priori hypothe-
ses, corrections for multiple comparisons were not
performed.

Neuroimaging data
All the following neuroimaging analyses were per-
formed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software
Version 8 (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neu-
roimaging, London, UK). 3D T1 images were ﬁrst
segmented for each participant, using a voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) method to isolate the grey-
matter partition, and normalized into the MNI standard
space. The resulting modulated normalized grey-
matter maps were then smoothed (8 × 8 × 8 mm) and
pooled by group for statistical analysis.
Intergroup comparison: Cortical grey-matter density
differences between the two groups were assessed
using voxel-based analysis (threshold for signiﬁcance:
p = 0.001, uncorrected; cluster = 20 voxels).
Correlation analyses: Correlations between grey-
matter density and percentages of between-utterance
pauses and non-grammatical pauses, were assessed
in each group using multiple regression (threshold
for signiﬁcance: p = 0.001, uncorrected; cluster = 20
voxels) for speciﬁc regions of interest (ROIs), in accor-
dance with our hypotheses. The ﬁrst ROI was deﬁned
using the Brodmann atlas: BA 10, corresponding to
the bilateral frontopolar areas. The second ROI (right
and left hippocampi) was extracted using automatic
regional labeling (anatomical automatic labeling,
AAL [56]).
RESULTS
Pre-inclusion assessment
Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD and 15
cognitively normal individuals were included in the
study. Demographic data and performances on the pre-
inclusion neuropsychological assessment are detailed
in Table 1. Patients and controls were matched for age
and level of education. Patients had signiﬁcantly lower
FCSRT, MMSE, and CDR scores. CSF samples were
available for 13 of the 15 patients. Amyloid pathol-
ogy was found in all of them. For the two remaining
patients, the AV-45 PET scan was rated as positive for
amyloid retention. None of the patients or cognitively
normal controls had an F&S score >2.
Neuropsychological assessment
Patients exhibited signiﬁcant anterograde declar-
ative
memory
impairments
on
all
tests.
Their
performances were also impaired on both free and cued
recall in the Epitoul test. Patients presented minor lan-
guage impairments (on naming and semantic ﬂuency).
Their processing speed and executive performance
were also lower than controls. No deﬁcits were found
in the other cognitive domains. Patients were neither
depressed nor anxious (Table 2).
Discourse analysis
Discourse organization
Patients produced fewer words during recall than
controls, but their total speech duration did not differ
signiﬁcantly. Patients also produced longer pauses on
average, but did not pause more often than controls, as
pause rates per 100 words did not differ signiﬁcantly.
All the results are shown in Table 3.
Pause use
Concerning the rate per 100 words of each type of
pause, we found that patients did not produce more
within-utterance pauses than controls. This applied to
both grammatical within-utterance pauses (patients =
16.36 ± 6.11, controls = 14.63 ± 5.74; p = 0.51) and
non-grammatical within-utterance pauses (patients =
4.05 ± 2.23; controls = 8.45 ± 5.66; p = 0.54). How-
ever, their between-utterance pause rate per 100

As shown in Fig. 1, results based on the percentage

in each group, except for between-utterance pauses.
Correlations with cognitive performance
Ecological memory assessment: In the patient group,
Epitoul cued recall was correlated with the three
FCSRT free and cued recalls (r = 0.54, p = 0.04), the
Rey ﬁgure (r = 0.54, p = 0.04), and the DMS48 Set 2
(r = 0.53, p = 0.04).
Anterograde episodic memory: In the patient group,
the between-utterance pause rate per 100 words
was positively correlated with Epitoul cued recall
(r = 0.55, p = 0.03) and with the sum of the three
FCSRT free and cued recalls (r = 0.58, p = 0.02). Sim-
ilarly, the percentage of between-utterance pauses was
positively correlated with both Epitoul cued recall
(r = 0.71, p = 0.003; Fig. 2) and the sum of the three
FCSRT free and cued recalls (r = 0.54, p = 0.02). The
non-grammatical within-utterance pause rate per 100
words was positively correlated with Epitoul cued
recall (r = 0.54, p = 0.04), as well as with the per-
centage of non-grammatical within-utterance pauses

tively correlated with Epitoul, albeit to a lesser extent
(r = –0.54, p = 0.04; Fig. 2), but not with the FCSRT
(r = –0.36, p = 0.19). No correlations were found with
the percentage of non-grammatical within-utterance
pauses in this group.
Lexical-semantic performance: No correlations were
observed in either group between the naming and
semantic ﬂuency tasks and the different types of
pauses.
Neuroimaging results
Intergroup comparison
Compared with controls, patients had signiﬁcant
temporal atrophy, mainly located in the left anterior
hippocampus and right posterior hippocampus, as well
as frontal and parietal grey-matter loss (Supplementary
Fig. 1).
Correlation analyses
In the patient group, we found a negative correlation
between the percentage of between-utterance pauses
and grey-matter density in BA 10 (T = 6.27; x = 10,
y = 68, z = 12) (Fig. 3). No correlations were found
with the hippocampi. No correlation was found in the
control group for either ROI.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to gain a better under-
standing of aspects of autobiographical discourse
impairment in AD, adopting an approach that
combined psycholinguistic measures with neuropsy-
chological and neuroimaging data. We showed that,
compared with cognitively normal controls, patients
with MCI due to AD made greater use of between-
utterance pauses. Moreover, only in this group the
number of these speciﬁc pauses was positively cor-
related with episodic memory performance. Finally,
we showed a link between BA 10 atrophy and the
production of between-utterance pauses.

Pausing during autobiographical discourse in
Alzheimer’s disease
Patients were less efﬁcient than controls during
autobiographical discourse production. Despite a com-
parable number of pauses, patients produced fewer
words per minute because their pauses were longer.
Contrary to the ﬁndings of previous studies [13],
patientsdidnotproducemorenon-grammaticalwithin-
utterance or grammatical within-utterance pauses than
controls. Patients did, however, use more between-
utterance pauses than controls in their discourses, and
these pauses represented a higher proportion of total
pauses.Theuseofbetween-utterancepausesmayreﬂect
a greater need for recall and planning during autobi-
ographical discourse. This hypothesis was mentioned
by Singh et al. [15]. Those authors demonstrated that
patients had lower speech rates because of longer
pauses, and not because of more frequent ones. For the
authors,planningdifﬁcultieswasapossibleexplanation
of these results. According to them, effort and plan-
ning are reﬂected more by long pauses than by frequent
ones. They also suggested that pauses at the beginning
of utterances needed to be investigated in greater detail,
in order to focus on planning difﬁculties. Other authors
have highlighted links between pauses and cognition:
Hoffmann et al. [14] showed that speech and hesitation
rates were negatively correlated with patients’ global
cognitive performance assessed by the MMSE scores.
We cannot rule out possible lexical access impairment
in the interpretation of these results.
Both non-grammatical within-utterance pauses and
between-utterance pauses were positively correlated
with patients’ performances on Epitoul cued recall. We
suggest that, in order to provide episodic details during
their discourse, patients had to make non-grammatical,
within-utterance pauses. By contrast, pausing between
utterances may have been a compensatory strategy.
Taking time between two utterances had a positive
effect on patients’ memory recall and discourse plan-
ning, leading to better memory performance. In the
cognitively normal group, between-utterance pauses
were negatively correlated with episodic memory per-
formance. In other words, controls with higher rates of
between-utterance pauses had lower memory scores.
Healthy individuals are probably able to carry out men-
tal travel and discourse planning without needing to
pause.
In previous studies of autobiographical discourse,
pausing was attributed to lexical-semantic deﬁcits [13,
14]. In the present study pausing was not correlated
with lexical-semantic processing in either group. Our
resultsleadtoseveralconclusionsthatdifferfromthose
reachedinpreviousstudiesofspeechprocessinginAD.
While not denying the presence of an early lexical and
semantic impairment, we highlight another link with
cognition. We should, however, point out that these
results may have been inﬂuenced by the high cognitive
load of the task we administered as autobiographical
recallisprobablymoredifﬁcultthanstandardizedtasks.
Access to the lexicon may also be more challenging
for patients than lexical-semantic tasks we used during
the neuropsychological assessment. Nonetheless, the
fact that patients were slightly impaired on the naming
task may minimize the expected correlation between
naming and pauses produced during Epitoul recall. It

would therefore be interesting to go further with more
sensitive lexical-semantic tasks to test links between
memory and lexical impairment.
Neuroimaging data and autobiographical
discourse
Our neuroimaging analysis shed light on the relation
between BA 10 grey matter density and between-
utterance pauses. Among patients, percentage of
between-utterance pauses was negatively correlated
withBA10grey-matterdensity:patientswhoproduced
more between-utterance pauses had greater atrophy
in this region. We hypothesize that between-utterance
pauses constitute a mechanism that compensates for
deﬁcits in memory access and discourse planning.
This is consistent with the gateway hypothesis [32],
as between-utterance pauses are thought to reﬂect a
gateway between inner life (i.e., introspection, mental
time travel, recall planning) and the outside world (i.e.,
current recall situation). According to this hypothesis,
attention is continuously switched between internal
and external processing when performing a task.
However, as patients have greater atrophy than healthy
individuals, this switching between their mental life
and the outside world is still possible, but takes more
effort. We hypothesize that one way for them to remedy
thisistomakepauses.Wecanassumethatinthecontrol
group, the gateway between the previous mini-events
and recall was established immediately, without any
need for pausing.
More generally, frontopolar area is known to play an
important role in human cognition: it is involved in dif-
ferent cognitive operations and supports a wide range
of cognitive tasks. Despite increasing research, this
regionremainsratherpuzzling,andresultsarevariable.
To explain this variability, Burgess et al. [32] argued
that BA 10 gateway is important during ill-structured
situations.Ill-structuredsituationsaresituationswhere
itisnotobvioushowtobehave[57],whichisthecaseof
many communicative situations. Discourse processing
can certainly be regarded as an ill-structured situation,
as it requires topic, cognitive, and behavioral man-
agement that varies with the circumstances. However,
frontopolar area functions have rarely been investi-
gated by means of language tasks. Using structural
imaging, Ash et al. [26] found that impaired speech
ﬂuency during storytelling was related to BA 10 atro-
phy in Lewy body spectrum disorder. Basso Moro
et al. [58], meanwhile, using spoken narrative recall
in healthy individuals, observed frontopolar activation
during retrieval processes, which they attributed to the
construction of the overall coherence that is crucial for
story recall.
Future directions
Using autobiographical discourse has several clin-
ical beneﬁts. As indicated by Bliss et al. [59], it
represents the most challenging type of narrative. It
requires planning around a theme, but also reﬂects
social skills and functional communication.
In the present study, we showed a correlation
between pauses and memory performance in an autobi-
ographical memory task. It would be useful to compare
this task with a narrative discourse based on visual
cues. This would be an interesting way of determining
the inﬂuence of memory, planning and lexical retrieval
during discourse production in patients with AD.
Moreover, narrative tasks are supposed to reﬂect
everyday communication. Our results may open up
new rehabilitation perspectives for patients with neu-
rodegenerative disorders. If pausing improves memory
processing and/or discourse planning, one way of
enhancing patients’ narrative performance would be
to develop rehabilitation programs that encourage
patients to pause and take the time to relive the event
they are talking about.
