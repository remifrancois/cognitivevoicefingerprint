Abstract
Ribosomes perform protein synthesis but are also involved in signaling processes, the full extent of 
which are still being uncovered. We report that phenotypes of mutating ribosomal proteins (Rp’s) 
are largely due to signaling. Using Drosophila, we discovered that a bZip-domain protein Xrp1 
becomes elevated in Rp mutant cells. Xrp1 reduces translation and growth, delays development, is 
responsible for gene expression changes, and causes the cell competition of Rp heterozygous cells 
from genetic mosaics. Without Xrp1, even cells homozygously-deleted for Rp genes persist and 
grow. Xrp1 induction in Rp mutant cells depends on a particular Rp with regulatory effects, 
RpS12, and precedes overall changes in translation. Thus effects of Rp mutations, even the 
reduction in translation and growth, depend on signaling through the Xrp1 pathway and are not 
simply consequences of reduced ribosome production limiting protein synthesis. One benefit of 
this system may be to eliminate Rp-mutant cells by cell competition.
eTOC
Certain mutant cells are eliminated only in mosaic tissues. Lee et al. isolate mutations in a bZip 
domain protein, Xrp1, that rescue ribosomal protein (Rp) heterozygous mutant cells from such 
competition. Xrp1 accounts for many aspects of the Rp mutant phenotype, indicating they are not 
direct consequences of ribosome depletion.

INTRODUCTION
Ribosomes are the essential protein synthetic machines of the cell. Large and small subunits 
(LSU and SSU), 40S and 60S in eukaryotic cells, form an 80S complex together with 
mRNA and perform translation in the cytoplasm. Each ribosome subunit is a 
ribonucleoprotein complex containing one (SSU) or three (LSU) non-coding rRNA 
molecules and a battery of ribosomal proteins (Rp’s) and is assembled in the nucleolus for 
export to the cytoplasm. Ribosomal proteins can contribute to folding and assembly of the 
ribosomal subunits as well as their function in translation(de la Cruz et al., 2015). Most 
ribosomal proteins are essential and cells homozygous for their mutations die, while 
heterozygous Rp mutants that lack one copy of the gene are abnormal in both humans and in 
Drosophila.
To what extent do the defects in ribosomal protein mutants reflect deficient translation, and 
to what extent do they reflect signaling pathways that monitor ribosome status? Aspects of 
Diamond Blackfan Anemia, the ribosomopathy that occurs in humans heterozygous for 
mutations in a number of Rp genes, are thought to reflect chronic p53 signaling, activated by 
accumulation of a ribosome assembly intermediate and nucleolar stress(Ellis, 2014; Raiser 
et al., 2014). On the other hand, Diamond Blackfan Anemia is also characterized by short 
stature and delayed maturation as well as skeletal defects (Vlachos et al., 2014; Mirabello et 
al., 2017), and Diamond Blackfan Anemia has sometimes been treated with L-leucine to 
stimulate protein synthesis (Pospisilova et al., 2007; Payne et al., 2012). Reduced protein 
synthesis has been measured in both Drosophila embryos and in mouse fibroblasts and 
hematopoietic cells from heterozygous, Rp+/− genotypes (Boring et al., 1989; Oliver et al., 
2004; Cmejlova et al., 2006; Signer et al., 2014).
We made use of Drosophila to investigate the effects of Rp mutations further. Drosophila 
that are haploinsufficient for any of 66 of the 79 Rp genes exhibit a common phenotype first 
recognized a century ago (the ‘Minute’ phenotype) which includes a reduction in the size 
and thickness of bristles on the adult body (“Minute” bristles) and a developmental delay 
associated with reduced translation and growth rate (Bridges and Morgan, 1923; Boring et 
al., 1989; Marygold et al., 2007). Unlike the bristle structures, most mutant cells are of 
normal size, as are mutant flies themselves, suggesting that the extended growth period is 
sufficient to compensate for reduced cellular growth(Neufeld et al., 1998; Montagne et al., 
1999). In fact mutant organs can be larger than normal, depending on the particular balance 
of growth between organs(Lin et al., 2011).
In Drosophila, and possibly in mammals, Rp+/− genotypes are subject to ‘cell competition’ 
in genetic mosaics(Morata and Ripoll, 1975; Oliver et al., 2004). If growing imaginal discs 
(progenitor cells that grow in an undifferentiated state in the larva to give rise to the adult 
tissues) contain both wild type and Rp+/− cells, the latter are progressively lost during

growth. Conversely, wild type cells growing in Rp+/− backgrounds come to dominate 
developmental compartments at the expense of the Rp+/− cells (Morata and Ripoll, 1975; 
Simpson, 1979). Both competitive situations are associated with selective apoptosis of Rp+/− 
cells in proximity to wildtype, which is responsible for the loss of Rp+/− clones (Claveria 
and Torres, 2016; Baker, 2017). There are other genotypes that can be competed from 
genetic mosaics but neither is it clear that the mechanisms are the same nor whether deficits 
in translation or growth are required (Claveria and Torres, 2016; Baker, 2017). There are 
also examples of ‘super-competitor’ genotypes that can eliminate nearby wild type cells, 
even though wild type cells should have normal ribosomes(de la Cova et al., 2004; Moreno 
and Basler, 2004; Tyler et al., 2007; Neto-Silva et al., 2010). In the mouse embryo, cells 
expressing more Myc or less p53 are super-competitors (Claveria et al., 2013; Dejosez et al., 
2013; Zhang et al., 2017).
Cell competition is also seen in mammalian cell co-cultures, in many cases eliminating 
hyperplastic or preneoplastic cells(Hogan et al., 2009; Kajita et al., 2010; Chiba et al., 2016; 
Wagstaff et al., 2016). Such cells can also be eliminated from mosaics with otherwise 
normal tissues in vivo(Leung and Brugge, 2012; Brown et al., 2017).
The studies reported here originated in a genetic screen designed to identify new 
components of cell competition. This led to isolation of a mutation affecting a bZip-domain 
protein gene, Xrp1 (Lee et al., 2016). Xrp1 was previously known as a putative transcription 
factor induced by p53 following X-irradiation of Drosophila, and implicated in genome 
maintenance, although no point mutant alleles had been studied previously(Brodsky et al., 
2004; Akdemir et al., 2007). Xrp1 was also characterized as a component of the protein 
complex that binds to the P element transposon in Drosophila, and found to contribute to P 
element transposition(Francis et al., 2016). We report a major role for Xrp1 in multiple 
features of Rp mutants. Xrp1 expression is induced in mutant cells by a signal from the 
ribosome and controls cellular translation rate and growth in addition to cellular 
competitiveness and almost the entire gene expression signature of Rp+/− cells. Xrp1 is even 
responsible for eliminating cells homozygously mutant for essential Rp genes that are 
deficient for new ribosome biogenesis. We conclude that Xrp1 controls a cellular stress 
pathway that monitors ribosomal proteins, regulates multiple cellular properties and acts 
upstream of the major defects in global translation, which are in fact only indirectly related 
to the initial mutation of a ribosomal protein gene.
RESULTS
Xrp1 is required for cell competition
A point mutation in gene encoding the putative transcription factor Xrp1 was isolated in a 
genetic screen designed to reveal defects in cell competition (Lee et al., 2016). The Xrp1 
transcription unit on the right arm of the third chromosome encodes two protein isoforms 
(Figure 1A). The Xrp1m2-73 allele we isolated corresponds to a G-to-T transition replacing a 
Glu codon with a premature stop codon(Lee et al., 2016). The mutation affects an exon 
common to both Xrp1 isoforms of the protein and is predicted to truncate the long form after 
Thr367 and the short form after Thr105, before an AT-hook motif and basic leucine zipper 
(bZip) domain that occur near the C-termini of both isoforms (Figure 1A).

The effects of Xrp1 mutations on cell competition are illustrated in Figure 1. Normally, cell 
competition is expected in mosaic imaginal discs that contain both wild type and Rp+/− cells. 
The Rp+/− cells undergo competitive apoptosis near the wild type cells, which grow to 
predominate in the tissue, as illustrated when clones of RpS3+/+ cells grow in RpS3+/− wing 
imaginal discs (Figure 1B, D, E))(Morata and Ripoll, 1975; Li and Baker, 2007; Martin et 
al., 2009). We did not observe cell competition when an Xrp1 mutation was also present, 
however. Clones of Xrp1−/− cells growing in an RpS3+/− Xrp1+ wing disc induced very little 
competitive cell death and the Xrp1−/− clones occupied significantly less territory than wild 
type clones achieved in RpS3+/− imaginal discs (Figure 1C-E).
In another cell competition assay, where the imaginal discs are initially wild type and mitotic 
recombination generates clones of Rp+’ cells, cell competition would normally prevent such 
cells from growing and surviving for long(Morata and Ripoll, 1975; Simpson, 1979; Moreno 
et al., 2002; Tyler et al., 2007)(Figure 1F). In contrast to this, clones of RpL36+/−; Xrp1−/− 
cells survived and differentiated in RpL36+/+; Xrp1+/− animals (Figure 1G). Thus, Xrp1 
mutation prevented cell competition between wild type and RpS3+/− or RpL36+/− genotypes.
To address how Xrp1 affects cell competition, we first looked at gene expression changes 
that have been reported during cell competition(Moreno et al., 2002; Portela et al., 2010). 
Previously, the extracellular matrix protein Sparc was reportedly induced in competing cells. 
In our hands the antibody mAb30A1B4 labeled a nuclear antigen expressed by all Rp+/− disc 
cells, regardless of proximity to Rp+/+ cells (Figure 1H-I). Whether or not this mAb30A1B4 
staining in Rp+/− cells represents Sparc protein, it was eliminated by the Xrp1 mutation 
(Figure 1J-K). Likewise, and as also reported by others (Kucinski et al., 2017), we also 
found that Puc-LacZ was elevated in all Rp+/− cells, not only those close to wild type cells in 
mosaics (Figure 1L-M). The Xrp1 mutation reduced puc-LacZ expression in Rp+/− cells 
(Figure 1N-O).
Because Xrp1 affected gene expression that occurred throughout Rp+/− tissues, not just in 
Rp+/− cells in close proximity to wild type cells, we wondered whether Xrp1 might act 
directly in Rp+/− cells. In the experiments described above, Rp+/− cells were heterozygous 
for the Xrp1m2-73 mutation, suggesting this mutation acted dominantly. Consistent with this, 
no competition was observed between wild type and RpS18+/− cells in a Xrp1m2-73/+ 
background (Figures 1P-Q, S1A-D). The dominant function occurred cell-autonomously in 
the Rp+/− cells, because competition was also absent between wild type clones, lacking any 
Xrp1 mutation, and Xrp1m2-73/+ RpS3−/+ cells (Figures 1R-U, S1E).
The truncated proteins encoded by Xrp1m2-73 should lack both the AT hook and bZIP DNA 
binding domains and might lack Xrp1 function. To test whether loss of one Xrp1 gene copy 
affected cell competition, effects of chromosomal deletions were examined. Consistent with 
dominant haploinsufficiency, cell competition did not occur between wild type and 
RpS18+/− cells when one Xrp1 copy was mutated (Figure S1G-K). This was tested with 
Df(3R)Exel6181 and Df(3R)Exel6182 (Figure S1G-K), chromosome deletions that extend 
into the left or right parts of the Xrp1 locus, respectively (Figure 1A). By contrast, cell 
competition continued in heterozygotes for Df(3R)Exel6187, a similar deficiency that 
deletes other chromosomal regions but not the Xrp1 gene (Figure S1F). Cell competition

was also lacking in the genetic background Xrp1D1/+ (Figure S1L,M). We generated Xrp1D1 
through a targeted deletion by recombination between FRT sequences of known locations 
that deleted all of the Xrp1 locus and parts of the neighboring genes (Figure 1A). All these 
heterozygous genotypes reduced cell competition to a degree similar to genotypes that 
completely lacked any functional Xrp1 gene, including Xrp1m2-73/D1, Xrp1m2-73/
Df(3R)Exel6182, and Df(3R)Exel6181/Df(3R)Exel6182, (Figure S1N-P). All these Xrp1 
genotypes were viable and fertile as adults, indicating that Xrp1 is dispensable for wild type 
development and viability.
In the course of the experiments it became clear that removing Xrp1 function was able to 
ameliorate the effects even of homozygous Rp mutations. Most Rp mutations are cell-
autonomously lethal as homozygotes, reflecting the essential role of most Rp in ribosome 
function(Lambertsson, 1998; Marygold et al., 2007). Mitotic recombination in the Rp+/− 
genotypes used in this paper generates Rp+/− cells as reciprocal recombinants to the Rp+/+ 
cells, but whereas Rp+/+ cell clones grow and outcompete Rp+/− neighbors, clones of Rp+/− 
cells are normally lost from imaginal discs soon after generation (Morata and Ripoll, 1975; 
Kale et al., 2015a)(Figure 1R,S). By contrast, clones of Xrp1−/− RpS3−/− cells survived in 
wing imaginal discs 72-96h h after induction of mitotic recombination, although they 
underwent only limited proliferation to attain a small size(Figure 1T-U). Sequencing the 
mutant RpS3 transcription unit revealed four nucleotide substitutions compared to the 
reference sequence (Figure S2). One was intronic, two were predicted to be silent but one 
mutates the ATG start codon to GTG, with no alternative ATG in frame from which RpS3 
translation could be initiated (Figure S2). As with RpS3, small clones of RpS18−/− 
Xrp1m2-73/D1 cells were also observed in wing imaginal discs 72-96h h after induction of 
mitotic recombination (Figure S1N), and the same for RpS18−/− Xrp1m2-73/Df(3R)Exel6182 
(Figure S1O), and RpS18−/− Df(3R)Exel6181/Df(3R)Exel6182 (Figure S1P). We don’t 
know if these cells survive indefinitely, however, since some were undergoing cell death 
(Figure S1N-P).
To determine whether Xrp1 was required for cell death in general, eye development was 
compared between wild type and the Df(3R)Exel6181/Df(3R)Exel6182 genotype that lacks 
a normal Xrp1 gene (Figure 2). During normal development, apoptosis eliminates 
supernumerary cells first from the pupal retina and then from the margins of the eye 
field(Wolff and Ready, 1991)(Figure 2A,C). Neither wave of apoptosis was affected in 
Df(3R)Exel6181/Df(3R)Exel6182, and the subsequent cellular composition of the retina was 
indistinguishable from wild type, confirming that developmental apoptosis in 
Df(3R)Exel6181/Df(3R)Exel6182 and wild type was quantitatively equivalent (Figure 2 
B,D,E). These findings illustrated that Xrp1 function was not required for all developmental 
cell death, although it was required for cell death during cell competition.
Xrp1 is a negative growth regulator
Our results suggested that Xrp1 could affect the growth of Rp+/’cells, as well as their 
competitiveness. This was because in addition to preventing competitive apoptosis, Xrp1 
mutations also decreased the relative size of wild type clones compared to the Rp+/− 
Xrp1+/− areas of mosaic discs (Figure 1C,E, Q,T, Figure S1B,D, G, H, J). This could be

explained if Rp+/− cells that are also mutated for Xrp1 grow more rapidly than plain Rp+/− 
cells, reducing the growth differential with Rp+/+ cells(Martin et al., 2009). To test this, the 
relative growth of RpS18+/− cells was compared with that of RpS18+/−; Xrp1−/− cells. These 
were obtained as reciprocal mitotic recombinants in RpS18+/−; Xrp1+/− imaginal discs 
(Figure 3A,B). The RpS18++/− ; Xrp1−/− clones grew at more than twice the rate of 
RpS18+/− Xrp1++/+ clones, indicating that wild type Xrp1 function retards the growth of 
RpS18+/− cells. This was specific to Rp+/− mutant cells, because Xrp1−/− clones grew 
identically to Xrp1+/+ controls in tissues that lacked any Rp mutation(Figure 3A-C).
These results prompted us to examine the effect of Xrp1 on the overall growth of the 
organism. Whereas adults of the genotype RpS3+/− emerged 1.7 days later than controls, on 
average, heterozygosity for Xrp1 reduced the delay to 0.8 days, on average (Figure 3D). 
Similarly, whereas adults of the genotype RpS18+/− emerged 1.4 days later than controls, on 
average, the delay was reduced to 0.8 day by heterozygosity for Xrp1, and to 0.4 day in 
RpS18+/−Xrp1−/− (Figure 3E). These findings extended to mutations affecting the large 
ribosomal subunit. Adults of the genotype RpL36+/− emerged ~2 days later than controls, on 
average, the delay was reduced to ~1.3 days by heterozygosity for the Xrp1 (Figure 3F). In 
contrast to these effects on the rate of development, the size of bristles from RpS18+/− adults 
was much less affected by Xrp1 genotype (Figure 3G-I and Figure S3A-D).
Xrp1 expression is induced in Rp mutant cells to slow growth
In order to understand how Xrp1 might affect specifically the growth of Rp+/− genotypes, 
qRT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from wing imaginal discs to examine Xrp1 
transcription. In comparison to tubulin mRNA, the various isoforms of transcript were from 
2-fold to 6-fold more abundant in RpS18+/− tissue (Figure 3J and Figure S3E). Transcription 
was also assessed independently through an enhancer trap P{PZ}Xrp102515, (Figure 1A). 
Little expression of this transcriptional reporter was detected in wild type imaginal discs but 
expression was elevated cell-autonomously in Rp+/− cells (Figure 3K-L). As would be 
expected from the elevated transcription, we also found using an antibody that Xrp1 protein 
levels were elevated in Rp+/− cells, compared to wild type (Figure 3M-N).
When over-expressed at high levels, Xrp1 acts as a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation in 
cultured cells and prevents growth and survival of imaginal disc cells (Akdemir et al., 2007; 
Tsurui-Nishimura et al., 2013). Transcriptional induction in the developing Drosophila eye 
disc using the Gal4 system ablates the adult eye almost completely (Figure 3O-P). These 
findings suggest that elevated Xrp1 transcription and protein, such as occur in Rp+/− cells, 
could be sufficient to restrict growth.
Xrp1 inhibits translation in Rp mutant cells
When cell cycle markers were compared between clones of Rp+/− Xrp1−/− cells and clones 
of Rp+/− Xrp1+/+ cells that were growing at different rates, no differences were seen in 
Histone H3 phosphorylation or Cyclin B expression, markers of progression through M-
phase and S-G2-phases of the cell cycle respectively (Figure S4A-D and S4I-K). There was 
also no difference in average cell size (Figure S4E-G), which is consistent with prior studies 
reporting that RpS3+/− cells are the same size as wild type cells(Neufeld et al., 1998). These

findings indicate that physiological levels of Xrp1 slowed the growth rate of imaginal disc 
cells without a major effect on one particular cell cycle transition.
To understand how growth was altered without any specific cell cycle transition, we 
investigated the rate of translation in imaginal discs. An alkyne analog of puromycin, O-
propargyl-puromycin (OPP) has been used as a Click chemistry reagent for fluorescent 
labeling of nascent protein synthesis in tissue culture cells (Liu et al., 2012). When imaginal 
discs explanted from wild type larvae were incubated with OPP, incorporation was seen in 
somewhat patchy patterns (Figure 4A-B and Figure S4L-N). Although the inhomogeneity 
was unexpected, because proliferation is reportedly uniform at these wing disc stages, the 
translation patterns closely resemble those recently described for phospho-RpS6 and which 
reflect TORC1-dependent growth in the wing imaginal disc(Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2017). 
OPP incorporation was abolished by cycloheximide, indicating dependence on translation 
(Figure 4E), and reduced by knockdown or mutation of genes that promote translation, 
including Tor, myc, and GADD34, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF2a (Figure 4C-D 
and Figure S4O-T). Taken together with the correlation with TORC1 signaling, these 
controls justify use of OPP incorporation to measure bulk translation rates in imaginal discs.
When translation rates were compared between wild type and Rp+/− cells in the same 
imaginal discs, lower translation was consistently seen in Rp heterozygous cells (RpS18+/−, 
RpS17+/−, RpL27A+/− and RpS3+/− were examined)(Figure 4F-N and data not shown). To 
assess whether lower translation was a cell-autonomous property of Rp+/− cells, or might be 
due to competition with wild type cells, we examined discs where A and P compartments 
were of different genotypes, since cells do not compete across the compartment 
boundary(Simpson and Morata, 1981). These experiments showed that translation rate was 
cell-autonomously lower in Rp+/− compartments than in wild type cells in the other 
compartment, indicating that it was a property of Rp+/− cells not experiencing cell 
competition (Figure 4O-P).
When RpS18+/− cells were studied in the presence of Xrp1 mutations, the difference in 
translation rate between wild type and RpS18+/− cells could no longer be detected (Figure 
4Q-T). Taken together, these results suggest that RpS18+/− cells genotypes grow more 
slowly as a result of reduced translation rate, and that Xrp1 is responsible for the reduced 
translation rate.
Xrp1 has little effect on ribosome number
One factor that could affect translation rates was the number of ribosomes. To assess how 
mutations in Rp genes or Xrp1 affected ribosome biogenesis, we used northern blotting to 
estimate the steady state levels of mature rRNA in wing imaginal disc cells. In Drosophila as 
in other eukaryotes, 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNA are processed from a common precursor RNA 
during the assembly of the ribosomal subunits(Long and Dawid, 1980; Kressler et al., 2017). 
For the SSU, a final cleavage generates the 18S rRNA from a 20S species once assembled 
SSU are exported into the cytoplasm(Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2005). For the LSU, trimming of 
the 28S and 5.8S rRNA’s to their mature forms may be a requirement for the nuclear export 
machinery(Ohmayer et al., 2013). Thus levels of these mature rRNA’s are expected to 
reflect numbers of mature ribosomal subunits.

When equal levels of total RNA were blotted from wild type, RpS18+/− wing discs, RpS3+/− 
wing discs, and RpL27A+/− wing discs, similar levels of 18S rRNA were detected, when 
normalized against actin or tubulin mRNAs in the same samples, indicating similar 
concentrations of mature SSU in these genotypes relative to mRNA (Figure 5A,B). 
However, lower levels of 5.8S rRNA were detected in RpL27A+/− wing discs, consistent 
with reduced levels of LSU in this RpL mutation only, not in the two RpS mutants (see 
Figure 5 legend for statistical comparisons of rRNA levels between genotypes). It is most 
convenient to monitor LSU through the 5.8S rRNA band (Figure 5C) because the 28S rRNA 
is further cleaved in Drosophila to forms that run on top of the 18S rRNA.
These same analyses were also performed using wing discs from the same genotypes but 
also heterozygous for the Xrp1 mutation, for which restoration of growth and/or translation 
rates had been observed. In no case did Xrp1 mutation much affect the relative ribosome 
content. That is, steady-state rRNA levels (relative to mRNA) were not significantly 
different between RpS18+/− and RpS18+/− Xrp1+/− wing discs, RpS3+/− and RpS3+/− 
Xrp1+/− wing discs, or between RpL27A+/− and RpL27A+/− Xrp1+/− wing discs (Figure 5B-
C). We also noted similar rRNA levels in wild type and Xrp1+/− wing discs (Figure 5B-C).
Taken together, these findings suggest that wing discs from three Rp+/− genotypes might 
contain similar SSU subunit levels to wild type wing discs. LSU levels were also similar in 
two mutants where the affected Rp was a component of the SSU, but a mutation in the LSU 
protein RpL27A reduced LSU numbers. If RpS3 and RpS18 mutations reduced translation 
without much reducing levels of ribosomal subunits, and Xrp1 had little effect on subunit 
numbers, either in wild type or in any of the Rp+/− genotypes, then Xrp1 expression may 
reduce translation rate of Rp+/− genotypes through some other mechanism.
Xrp1 regulates transcriptional responses in Rp/+ wing discs
Since Xrp1 is even responsible for the changes in overall translation in Rp+/− cells, we 
wondered whether Xrp1 controls all the effects of Rp+/− mutations. Hundreds of genes show 
altered transcription in Rp+/− wing discs, including components of the DNA damage 
response, oxidative stress response, innate immune response, Jnk pathway and Jak/Stat 
pathway(Kucinski et al., 2017). To assess how these transcriptional effects depended on 
Xrp1, we first isolated mRNA from wing imaginal discs from two independent genotypes, 
RpS3+/− and RpS17+/− for analysis by mRNA-Seq (Figure 6A). In comparison to parallel 
wild type controls, transcripts of 253 genes (189 increased and 64 decreased) were 
significantly altered in both Rp+/− genotypes, representing a shared response common to 
multiple Rp+/− genotypes (Figure 6B; Table S2). These genes were enriched for GO terms 
related to DNA repair and to oxidative stress(Figure 6C-E; Figure S4A). To validate the 
mRNA-Seq data, qRT-PCR was performed for one representative gene from each of the 
enriched GO-term classes (Irbp18, Mre11, GstE6, and Iscu), and each showed a significant 
change commensurate with the mRNA-Seq data (Figure S4B). These mRNA-Seq results 
verified the elevation of Xrp1 transcripts in both RpS17+/−, and RpS3+/−, and also 
documented 50% reduction in mRNA levels for RpS3 in RpS3+/−, and for RpS17 in 
RpS17+/−, which confirms that reduced expression of the ribosomal protein genes is the 
primary defect in these genotypes (Figure 6D).

signaling (Meyer et al., 2014), it is worth mentioning that several genes related to innate 
immunity were elevated in Rp+/− wing discs although such genes were not statistically 
enriched (Figure S5A). Other genes implicated in oxidation-reduction process, Jak-Stat 
signaling, and JnK signaling were among those altered in both RpS17+/−, and RpS3+/− wing 
discs, although these GO terms were not statistically enriched by our criteria (Figure S5A).
When mRNA was isolated from RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− wing discs, we found that transcription of 
RpS3 was not restored (Figure 6D). Although there was also a modest (10-20%) reduction in 
RpS17 transcription in RpS3+/− mutants and vice versa, RpS17 transcription was not 
restored in RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− wing discs either (Figure 6D). Thus there was no evidence for 
any role of Xrp1 in ribosome biogenesis through transcription of Rp genes. By contrast, we 
found that >81 % of the protein gene expression changes common to Rp+/− genotypes 
depended on Xrp1 (206 genes) (Figure 6B). This may represent an underestimate of the 
dependence on Xrp1, since perhaps some genes would only be affected by homozygous 
mutation of Xrp1. The Xrp1-dependent genes were enriched for the same biological process 
GO-terms as the complete set of Rp+/−-regulated genes, and included all 4 genes validated 
by qRT-PCR, which further supported Xrp1-dependent transcription for these genes (Figure 
S4B). Out of the 253 Rp+/−-regulated genes, 159 were also identified in a previous study of 
RpS3+/− wing discs(Kucinski et al., 2017)(Table S3). We found that 142 of these 159 genes, 
or >89%, were regulated by Xrp1. Taken together, these results demonstrated that, at least 
with regard to transcription, the large majority of changes in Rp+/− wing discs were 
mediated by Xrp1.
Xrp1 responds to an RpS12-dependent ribosomal distress signal
The finding that Xrp1 seems to be responsible for, and therefore upstream of the bulk 
translation defects of Rp+/− cells, raised the question of what mechanism upregulates Xrp1 
transcription in Rp+/− genotypes. The Xrp1 gene was first recognized as a gene 
transcriptionally induced by p53 in response to irradiation(Brodsky et al., 2004). However, 
p53 is dispensable for competition of Rp+/− cells by wild type, suggesting that p53 is 
unlikely to induce Xrp1 expression in Rp+/− cells(Kale et al., 2015a). In agreement with this, 
dominant-negative p53 did not affect the expression of the enhancer trap P{PZ}Xrp102515 in 
Rp+/−, indicating that Xrp1 transcription is elevated in Rp+/− cells independently of p53 
(Figure S5C-F).
Recently, we reported that a specific ribosomal protein, RpS12, plays a special role in cell 
competition, different from other ribosomal proteins(Kale et al., 2018). A missense mutant 
allele, rpS12G97D, protects Rp+/− genotypes from competition with wild type cells, whereas 
the wild type rpS12 allele is required for cell competition to occur. Accordingly, cells 
heterozygous for mutations in other Rp genes are not eliminated by competition with wild 
type cells if they also carry the rpS12G97D allele in place of the rpS12+ allele, whereas extra 
copies of the wild type rpS12 gene, or overexpression of the RpS12 protein, render cells 
heterozygous for other Rp mutations even less competitive(Kale et al., 2018). We therefore 
wondered whether rpS12, rather than p53, was required for transcription of Xrp1 in Rp+/− 
cells. We found that an rpS12 allele that prevents cell competition also blocked induction of

Xrp1 protein in Rp+/− wing discs (Figure 6F-I). Conversely, when RpS12 was overexpressed 
in Rp+/− wing discs, Xrp1 expression was further elevated (Figure 6J-K). Since expression 
of the Xrp1-LacZ enhancer trap in Rp+/− wing discs was also RpS12-dependent, an RpS12 
activity directly or indirectly induces Xrp1 transcription in Rp+/− cells (Figure 6L-O).
DISCUSSION
Most ribosomal protein genes are essential. Reflecting this importance, ribosomal protein 
mutations have dominant effects through haploinsufficiency. We have identified a bZip-
domain protein, Xrp1, which behaved like a master-regulator of responses to Rp mutations 
(Figure 7). Even the acute lethality of Rp+/− cells depended on Xrp1. The only aspect of the 
Rp+/− phenotype that appeared largely independent of Xpr1 was the reduced size of the 
bristles, which was only slightly restored by Xrp1 mutations (Figure 3I and Figure S2A-D). 
Bristle size might depend on ribosome function directly, or on a different regulatory gene 
that replaces Xrp1 in bristle precursors.
We first isolated a null allele of Xrp1 in a screen for mutations preventing cell competition. 
We found that Xrp1 transcription and Xrp1 protein were selectively elevated in Rp+/− cells 
and required cell-autonomously to render these cells less competitive than wild type cells 
(Figure 1 and Figure S1). Later we found that Xrp1 also acted to reduce the growth rate of 
Rp+/− cells (Figure 3A-C). In the absence of Xrp1, or even when Xrp1 gene dose was 
reduced to one copy, Rp+/− cells grew more like wild type cells. Xrp1 contributed 
substantially to the developmental delay of Rp+/− animals, which without Xrp1 could reach 
adulthood only slightly later than wild type animals, despite lacking one copy of essential 
Rp genes (Figure 3D-F).
Xrp1 probably reduces growth by reducing overall translation rate. Rp+/− cells had lower 
translation rates than wild type, but it was Xrp1, not haploinsufficiency for an important Rp 
gene, that reduced translation rate, because the difference from wild type disappeared when 
Xrp1 was mutated simultaneously (Figure 4 and Figure S4). Although ribosome numbers 
have not been counted directly, the proportion of rRNAs was not reduced in most Rp+/− 
genotypes, suggesting that an Xrp1-dependent reduction in translational activity per 
ribosome may occur. A mutation in RpL27A was the exception that did appear to reduce 
LSU number, but this was not rescued in RpL27A+/− Xrp1+/− discs and so was not 
responsible for the Xrp1-dependent growth inhibition (Figure 5). The persistence of Rp+/− 
mutant clones in the absence of Xrp1 also suggests changes in ribosome activity. Rp+/− cells 
should be deficient in synthesizing new ribosomes, so the prolonged survival of Rp+/− 
Xrp1−/− clones cannot easily be explained through restored ribosome biogenesis.
These findings suggest Xrp1 influences the rate of translation by cytoplasmic ribosomes, but 
they do not exclude additional roles in ribosome biogenesis. For example late third instar 
wing discs from wild type, RpS18+/−, and RpS18+/− Xrp1+/− larvae contained 
indistinguishable ribosome numbers (Figure 5), but these genotypes developed at different 
rates (Figure 3D-F). Based on the time taken for adults to emerge, we estimate that the 
ribosomes in late third instar wing discs had accumulated over ~80h, ~115h, and~100h of 
larval life respectively, so this is consistent with different rates of ribosome biogenesis

generating similar absolute numbers of ribosomes over different durations of larval 
development. A reduced rate of ribosome biogenesis was reported previously in the mouse 
RpL24Bst/+ mutant (Oliver et al., 2004).
Regarding the overall rate of organismal development, it is well known that progress through 
the insect lifecycle is controlled in part through systemic signals ultimately controlling 
ecdysone levels(Boulan et al., 2015). This is not the primary means that Xrp1 affects 
imaginal disc growth because this occurs cell-autonomously (Figure 3A-C). Additional, non-
autonomous effects of Xrp1 on organismal development are not ruled out. For example 
Dilp8, a secreted factor that regulates organismal growth(Boulan et al., 2015), undergoes 
Xrp1-dependent upregulation in Rp+/− wing discs(Figure S5A).
Hundreds of genes show altered mRNA levels in Rp+/− wing discs but it has not been clear 
how these changes arise (Kucinski et al., 2017). We now report that >80% of altered mRNA 
levels were Xrp1-dependent (Figure 6B). Some of these genes might be indirect targets of 
Xrp1, for example, Xrp1-dependent changes in overall translation rate may change gene 
transcription through a variety of mechanisms. The Xrp1-dependent changes include 
oxidative stress responses, which are reported to make cells less competitive (Kucinski et al., 
2017), and also DNA repair genes (Figure 6C-E and Figure S5A).
How is Xrp1 induced by Rp mutations? Xrp1 is a transcriptional target of p53 in the 
response to irradiation, but p53 is not required for the elimination of Rp+/− cells by cell 
competition(Kale et al., 2015b). Accordingly, we showed that p53 was not required for Xrp1 
induction in Rp+/− wing discs (Figure S5C-F). Reduced overall translation was unlikely to 
induce Xrp1 because Xrp1 was actually responsible for this. Perhaps more subtle changes in 
the translation of specific mRNA’s occur first and induce Xrp1 expression. Another 
possibility is that a signal is sent when ribosome assembly is altered, for example through an 
accumulated assembly intermediate. We report here that a particular ribosomal protein, 
RpS12, that was already recognized as a gene required for cell competition (Kale et al., 
2018), was required to elevate Xrp1 transcription (Figure 6J,K). Although we don’t yet 
know the molecular mechanism by which RpS12 can affect transcription, this demonstrates 
that a link between a particular ribosomal protein and the Xrp1 gene triggers most of the 
response that occurs to mutations in other Rp genes, upstream of overall changes in bulk 
translation rates, which are a later consequence of the Xrp1 pathway. All the DNA repair 
gene expression in Rp+/− wing discs was also downstream of Xrp1 (Figure 6D), and may 
reflect Xrp1’s other role in the response to irradiation(Brodsky et al., 2004; Akdemir et al., 
2007). How DNA repair genes contribute to aspects of the Rp+/− phenotype remains to be 
determined.
The importance of Xrp1 extends to homozygous Rp mutant cells. Remarkably, even Rp+/− 
cells survived and underwent limited growth if Xrp1 was completely removed. We don’t 
believe imaginal disc cells can grow and divide without ribosomes and protein synthesis, but 
since ribosome turnover occurs very slowly (Hirsch and Hiatt, 1966; Nikolov et al., 1983), 
Rp+/− recombinant cells probably retain most of the ribosome complement from the Rp+/− 
mother cell at first. They would be deficient in replenishing their ribosome complement, 
however, which would dilute with further growth and cell division. Previous studies indicate

that when ribosome activity diminishes below a critical threshold, Rp+/− cells undergo 
apoptosis(Kale et al., 2015b). The absence of Xrp1 allowed Rp+/− cells to survive longer, by 
allowing more translation by the remaining ribosomes, and possibly by preventing 
competitive elimination of Rp+/− cells by Rp+/− cells.
Despite the unquestioned importance of ribosomal proteins in ribosome structure and 
function, our results indicate that the effects of Rp mutations in Drosophila are largely due to 
a regulatory response (Figure 7). Even the reduced translation in Rp mutant genotypes, 
which has also been observed in other organisms (Oliver et al., 2004; Cmejlova et al., 2006; 
Signer et al., 2014), is downstream of Xrp1 and does not play a primary role as a sensor of 
Rp mutations. Even when Rp genes are homozygously mutated, which seemingly should 
affect overall translation very quickly, Xrp1 normally kills the Rp+/− cells before such effects 
become evident. Rp+/− cells can also be killed by Xrp1, but indirectly, by cell competition 
when wild type cells are nearby.
Mutations that reduce translation or ribosome biogenesis by other routes are phenotypically 
distinct from Rp mutants. For example, mutations in the myc gene homolog or in 
components of the Drosophila TOR pathway lead to smaller flies, unlike Rp+/− flies (Gallant 
et al., 1996; Schreiber-Agus et al., 1997; Bohni et al., 1999; Montagne et al., 1999). In 
mammals also, mutations that affect ribosome biogenesis independently of ribosomal 
protein genes lead to human disease but the symptoms of such ribosomopathies differ from 
Diamond Blackfan Anemia (McCann and Baserga, 2013; Armistead and Triggs-Raine, 
2014). These differences may occur because translation is affected indirectly in mutations of 
Rp genes and not the primary trigger for the cellular responses leading to pathology.
Although it may at first seem surprising that mutations in ribosomal proteins that are so 
directly involved in translation affect the cell through another mechanism, perhaps it is 
advantageous to mount such a coordinated response, for example to enable cell competition. 
Much as it is adaptive to eliminate cells with damaged DNA through apoptosis, perhaps cell 
competition is a mechanism to eliminate one or a few cells with defective ribosomes in favor 
of other, more normal cells.

METHOD DETAILS
Fly Stocks: Previously existing genetic strains are described in the Key Resources Table: 
Xrp1… was generated as a Flp-mediated excision between P(XP)d11439 and 
PBac(WH)f07598 and is a deletion of sequences 3R:18,912,939-18,938,334, completely 
encompassing the Xrp1 gene.
Clonal analysis: Genetic mosaics were generated using the FLP/FRT system employing 
hsFLP and eyFLP transgenic strains(Golic, 1991; Xu and Rubin, 1993; Newsome et al., 
2000). For making clones using inducible hsFLP, larvae of non-Minute genotypes were 
subjected to 1 hour heat shock at 37°C, 60 ± 12 hours after egg laying and dissected 60hr 
later. For Minute/+ genotypes, heat shock was administered after 84 ± 12 hours of egg 
laying and dissected 72 hours later. Full genotypes for all figures are listed in Supplemental 
Table 1.
Measurement of developmental timing: Development was monitored in cohorts of 
eggs laid within 8h periods. Cultures were monitored for adult emergence every 8h. 
Whenever possible experimental and control genotypes developed within the same vials and 
therefore same culture conditions, and were distinguished as adults using appropriate genetic 
markers. Where this could not be achieved, genotypes in common between the cultures were 
compared to assure comparable developmental rate.
Immunohistochemistry and Antibody labeling: For antibody labeling, imaginal discs 
were dissected from late 3rd instar larvae in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 
fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 M PIPES (pH 6.95), 3.7% formalin, 2 mM 
MgSO4, 1 mM EGTA. Fixed imaginal discs were washed in PDT (0.3% sodium 
deoxycholate, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) for 15 min on ice. 
Discs were incubated in primary antibody in PDT for overnight at 4°C, washed 3 times with 
PDT for 5 min each on ice and incubated in secondary antibody in PDT for 2-4 hours at 4°C, 
and washed 3 times with PDT for 5 min each on ice. After washes, discs were rinsed in 0.1 
M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and incubated in glycerol mounting solution (75% (v/v) 
glycerol, 2% (m/v) n-propyl gallate) for 15 min on ice before mounting(Baker et al., 2014). 
Primary Antibodies are described in the Key Resources Table. Secondary Antibodies were 
Cy2-, Cy3- and Cy5-conjugates from Jackson Immunoresearch.
Image Acquisition and Processing.—Confocal images were recorded using Leica SP2 
and SP5 confocal microscopes using 20× and 40× objectives. Images were processed using 
Image J1.44j and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended. Clone areas and perimeters were 
quantified from single confocal z-planes using the ‘Measure’ function in Image J 1.44j. 
Adult fly thoraces were dehydrated through an alcohol series and mounted in DPX medium 
for photography using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Thoracic bristle images were recorded 
using Leica M205 FA and Leica Application Suite X. Northern blots were quantitated using 
Image J
Quantitative real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wing imaginal discs of late 
third instar larvae in TRIzol reagents (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

RNA samples were DNase treated according to manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher; 
AM1907) and reverse transcribed using Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher; 
AB1453)..The cDNA was used to perform the qPCR reactions following the manufacturer’s 
instructions for the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher; 4367659). qPCR 
results were normalized to α-Tubulin (for Xrp1 transcripts) or CG13220 (during mRNA-Seq 
validation)(Ling and Salvaterra, 2011). See Table S4 for primer sequences.
Northern Analysis—Total RNA from wing imaginal discs from wandering 3rd instar 
larvae was prepared in TRIzol reagents (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Northern blot analysis was based on the Odyssey Northern blot analysis 
protocol (LI-COR) (http://biosupport.licor.com/support). Briefly, 1-2ug of total RNA were 
resolved on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred overnight by capillary transfer to 
Biodyne B Nylon membrane (Thermofisher). RNA was crosslinked onto nylon by baking at 
80oC for 30 minutes and prehybridized in ULTRAhyb-Oligo buffer (Ambion). RNA 
biotinylated probes were used for overnight hybridization (at 55°C or 68°C). Probes were 
transcribed from PCR-derived templates using T7 RNA polymerase (Maxiscript T7 
Transcription kit, Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Normalization 
controls were Actin 5C and alpha-tubulin 84B. After stringent washes and blocking with the 
Odyssey Blocking buffer (containing 1%SDS), the membrane was incubated with 
Streptavidin IRDye 800 CW (Li-CoR) and LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System was 
used to detect the signal.
Measurement of in vivo translation—Translation was detected by the Click-iT Plus 
OPP Alexa Fluor® 594 or 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermofisher) as described 
(Sanchez et al., 2016) with some modifications. Larvae were inverted in Schneider’s 
Drosophila medium (containing 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, GIbco) and 
transferred in fresh medium containing 1:1000 (20uM) of Click-iT OPP reagent. Samples 
were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and rinsed once with PBS. The samples 
were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 1× PEM buffer (100mM Pipes, 1mM EGTA, 1mM 
MgCl2) for 20 min, washed once with 1× PBS and subsequently washed with 0.5% Triton in 
1× PBS for 10 min and then incubated for 10 min with 3% BSA in 1× PBS. The Click 
reaction took place in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were washed once 
with the rinse buffer of the Click reaction kit, 2 minutes with 3% BSA in 1× PBS, incubated 
for 1 hour at room temperature with PBT (1× PBS, 0.2% Triton, 0.5% BSA) and after that 
incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4oC. Samples were washed 3× with PT 
buffer (1× PBS, 0.2% Triton) and the secondary antibody was added for 2 hrs in room 
temperature. After 3× washes with PT and 1× with 1× PBS, the samples were incubated 
with the Nuclear Mask reagent (1:2000) of the Click-iT kit for 30 min. After washing 2× 
with 1× pBS the imaginal discs were mounted in Vectashield. Confocal laser scanning 
images were acquired with a Leica Laser scanning microscope SP5.
mRNA-Seq—For mRNA-Seq studies, eggs laid in 4h cohorts were raised at 25°C on yeast-
glucose medium supplemented with 20μg/ml tetracycline to minimize potential differences 
in microbiome between genotypes. Precise genotypes were, for the wild type control: 
w11-18(+);p{ ry+ hs-neor FRT}82B p{w+}90E/+; for RpS17/+: w11-18(y w p{ ry+ hsF});

M(3L)67C p{ w+ ubi-GFP} p{ ry+ hs-neor FRT}80B/+; for RpS3/+: w11-18(y w p{ ry+ 
hsF}); p{ ry+ hs-neor FRT}82B M(3R)RpS3 p{ w+ arm-LacZ}/+; for RpS3/+ Xrp1/+: 
w11-18(y w p{ ry+ hsF}); p{ ry+ hs-neor FRT}82B M(3R)RpS3 p{ w+ arm-LacZ}/ p{ ry+ hs-
neor FRT}82B Xrp1m2-73. Third-instar larvae were harvested 24±2h before puparium 
formation (this corresponded to a different time after egg-laying for each genotype). From 
each genotype, ~50 wing discs were dissected into Trizol reagent (25 discs into 250μL) and 
frozen at −80°C. Following thawing and centrifugat ion (12000g 15 min 4°C), the aqueous 
phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol (10 min room temperature). The 
pellet was recovered by centrifugation (12000g 15 min 4°C), washed with RNAse-free 75% 
ethanol twice, and air dried (5-10 min room temperature) after removing the remaining 
ethanol with a filtered RNAse-free pipette tip. Samples were resuspended in RNAse-free 
water, analyzed by nanodrop spectroscopy and Bioanalyzer and satisfactory samples stored 
at −80°C prior to library construction, paired-end sequencing, mapping and alignment by 
Beijing Genomics Institute. Three independent replicates were analyzed for each genotype. 
At least 65,000,000 clean reads were obtained from every sample and at least 89% of reads 
were mapped from every sample.
Bioconductor DESEQ2 (Love et al., 2014) was used to identify genes expressed 
differentially between control and RpS17/+, between control and RpS3/+, between control 
and RpS3/+ Xrp1/+, and between RpS3/+ and RpS3/+ Xrp1/+. We defined genes regulated 
in Rp/+ genotypes as genes that were expressed differentially from control in both RpS17/+ 
and in RpS3/+, with probability Padj<0.1 and ∣log2fold change∣>0.5 in each case. Out of 264 
such genes, 11 were discarded due to opposite regulation in the two Minute genotypes. The 
number of false positives that remain due to chance deviation in gene expression in the same 
direction in the two Minute genotypes might be expected to be of similar magnitude. Among 
the 253 remaining candidate Rp+/− -regulated genes, we identified Xrp1-dependent Rp+/− -
regulated genes as genes expressed differentially between control and RpS3/+ but not 
between control and RpS3/+ Xrp1/+ or as genes expressed differentially between control 
and RpS3/+ and also between RpS3/+ and RpS3/+ Xrp1/+. There were 206 such genes. GO 
term and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the functional annotation tool 
DAVID6.8(Huang da et al., 2009b, a). We considered GO terms to be significantly enriched 
when p<0.05 after Benjamini correction for multiple tests.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical comparisons between individual mutant and control experiments were by 
Student’s t-test. Details including n values, are included in Figures and Figure legends. 
Where data analyzed were ratios of experimental and control results eg clone sizes 
compared to twin-clones, values were log-transformed for statistical analysis and mean
±SEM of the log transformed data reverse-transformed for presentation. Multiple sample 
comparison in Figure 5 was by one-way ANOVA, with the Bonferroni and Holm method to 
identify significant differences. Significance of differences between developmental rates 
(Figure 3) was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney procedure.

Figure 1. Xrp1 is required for cell competition
A) Features of chromosome 3R around position 18.92 Mb. Seven Xrp1 transcripts encoding 
two proteins are encoded in a 14 kb region between the CG14291 and Mpc1 genes. 
Locations of the LacZ enhancer trap insertion Xrp102515 and truncation allele Xrp1m2-73 are 
shown. DNA segments absent from deletion strains used in this paper are indicated in gold. 
B) Cell competition affects RpS3+/− cells in wing discs containing RpS3+/+ clones. Dying 
cells labeled for active Dcp1 (green) are predominantly at the interfaces between RpS3+/− 
cells (magenta) and wild type cells (nor magenta). C) In the presence of an Xrp1 mutation,

competitive cell death was reduced and clones of RpS3+/+ cells (unlabelled) colonized less 
of the tissue. See panels D-E for quantification. D) Competitive apoptosis of RpS3+/− cells 
next to RpS3+/+ cells was reduced ~10× in the presence of an Xrp1 mutation (p<0.0001, t-
test)(in this case the RpS3+/− wing was also Xrp1+/−). Error bars are ± 1 S.E.M. E) 
Colonization of the RpS3+/− wing disc by wild type clones was reduced >2× by an Xrp1 
mutation (p<0.0001, t-test)(the RpS3+/− wing was also Xrp1+/−). Error bars are ± 1 S.E.M. 
F) RpL36+/− clones (white) are rarely recovered in RpL36+/+ eyes(Tyler et al., 2007). G) 
RpL36+/− Xrp1−/− clones (white) were readily recovered in RpL36+/+ Xrp1+/− eyes. H, I) 
mAb30A1B4 detected an antigen that is expressed at higher levels in RpS3+/− cells in 
mosaic wing imaginal discs. J,K) mAb30A1B4 labeling of RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− cells dropped to 
the same level as RpS3+/+ Xrp1−/− cells in mosaic wing imaginal discs. L,M) Puc-LacZ was 
elevated in RpS18+/− cells compared to RpS18+/+ cells in mosaic wing discs. N,O) Puc-
LacZ levels were reduced in RpS18+/− Xrp1+/− cells to levels similar to RpS18+/+ Xrp1−/− 
cells. P) Cell competition affected RpS18+/− cells in wing discs containing RpS18+/+ clones. 
Note that the reciprocal clone genotype RpS18−/− was not observed. Q) Competitive 
apoptosis of RpS18+/− cells was absent from mosaic wing discs containing RpS18+/+ clones 
when all cells were heterozygous for Xrp1. Note that the reciprocal clone genotype 
RpS18−/− was not observed. R) Cell competition affected RpS3+/− cells in wing discs 
containing RpS3+/+ clones (in this experiment, RpS3+/+ clones were positively marked with 
an extra dose of beta-galactosidase transgene (magenta). S) Enlargement of the beta-
galactosidase channel from panel R. Note absence of any RpS3−/− cells lacking beta-
galactosidase. T) Cell competition did not affect RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− cells in wing discs 
containing RpS3+/+ Xrp1+/+ clones. Competitive apoptosis was reduced and colonization by 
RpS3+/+ Xrp1+/+ cells was reduced. In this experiment, RpS3+/+ Xrp1+/+ cells were 
distinguished by brighter labeling for ß –galactosidase than for the RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− cells 
(darker magenta). U) Enlargement of the beta-galactosidase channel from panel T. Note 
small clones of RpS3−/− Xrp1−/− cells lacking beta-galactosidase. Supplemental data related 
to this Figure is shown in Figures S1 and S2, and in Table S1.

Figure 2. Xrp1 does not affect developmental cell death in the retina
Panels A-D show pupal retinas labeled for Dlg protein to outline cells (green) and anti-active 
Dcp1 to reveal apoptotic cell death (magenta). A) 30h after puparium formation (APF). At 
this stage, apoptosis culls extra cells from the wild type retina. B) Similar cell death occurs 
in Xrp1−/− mutant retina 30h APF. C) At 43h APF, apoptosis removes cells from the retinal 
periphery. D) Cell death occurs similarly in Xrp1 mutant retina 43 APF. E) Supernumerary 
cells were counted 42 h APF to evaluate the efficiency of programmed cell death in the 
retina. There was no significant increase in supernumerary cells in the Xrp1−/− mutant, 
indicating that this developmental cell death occurred normally (t-test, p>0.05). Error bars 
indicate S.E.M. Supplemental data related to this Figure is shown in Table S1.

respective Rp+/− Xrp1+/− adults was highly significant (one-tailed Mann-Whitney test, 
p<0.00001 in all cases). In panel E, the accelerated development of RpS18+/− Xrp1−/− 
compared to RpS18+/− Xrp1+/− was highly significant (significant (one-tailed Mann-
Whitney test, p<0.00001) G) Scutellum of RpS3+/+ fly, showing the scutellar bristles. H) 
Scutellum of RpS3+/− fly, showing the scutellar bristles. See Figure S2 for more genotypes. 
I) Mean length of posterior scutellar bristles from genotypes indicated. RpS3+/− bristles 
were ~30% shorter than controls (p<0.0001, t-test). RpS3+/− Xrp1+/− bristles were no 
different. RpS3+/− Xrp1−/− bristles were slightly longer (~5%) and this difference was 
statistically significant (p<0.01, t-test). J) qRT-PCR measurements of Xrp1 transcript 
isoforms (see Figure 1A for diagram of isoforms). All the Xrp1 transcripts were elevated in 
RpS18+/− wing imaginal discs in comparison to wild type controls. See Figure S2 for qRT-
PCR data compared to tubulin mRNA levels. K) Mosaic wing disc containing RpS18+/− 
cells (labeled for ubi-GFP) and RpS18+/+ cells (unlabeled). L) Xrp1-LacZ labeling of the 
wing imaginal disc shown in panel K. Since the LacZ mRNA encoded by the enhancer trap 
insertion contains no sequences from Xrp1, elevated LacZ labeling likely reflects enhanced 
transcription. M) Mosaic wing disc containing RpS18+/− cells (labeled for ubi-GFP) and 
RpS18+/+ cells (unlabeled). N) Anti-Xrp1 labeling of the wing imaginal dsc shown in panel 
M. O) Flies heterozygous for the GMR-Gal4 transgene had normal eyes. P) Ectopic Xrp1 
expression under control of the GMR-Gal4 driver ablated the eye almost completely(Tsurui-
Nishimura et al., 2013). Supplemental data related to this Figure is shown in Figure S3 and

Figure 4. Protein synthesis in wing imaginal discs
A) Incorporation of o-propargyl puromycin (OPP) revealed mostly similar translation rates 
across the wing disc although with some patchiness. A single confocal plane is shown here. 
These patchy patterns seemed similar although not identical in individual wing discs (see 
Figure S3L-N for more examples). B) Since most newly-synthesized protein is nuclear, it is 
important to note that fluctuations in translation rate did not simply correlate with presence 
of nuclei in the confocal plane. C) Enlarged portion of wing disc containing dTor−/− clones 
(unlabelled cells, arrow). Only small dTor−/− clones were recovered, reflecting reduced 
growth. D) dTor−/− incorporated less OPP (arrow). E) OPP incorporation was inhibited by

Figure 5. Ribosome levels in wing imaginal discs
A) Northern blotting of total RNA samples from wing imaginal discs with multiple probes. 
Ethidium bromide staining verifies gel loading and membrane transfer of similar total RNA 
amounts from samples. The majority of total RNA is rRNA, and since the mature 28S rRNA 
is processed in Drosophila into two similarly-sized fragments, the 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA 
products appear as a single overlapping band. 18S rRNA (a component of mature SSU) and 
5.8S rRNA (a component of mature LSU) were detected using specific hybridization probes. 
The rRNA levels were normalized against mRNA for tubulin or actin detected on the same 
blots. mRNA-Seq has indicated that tubulin and actin mRNA levels are similar in wild type 
and RpS3/+ wing discs)(Kucinski et al., 2017 and data not shown), assuming that overall 
mRNA concentrations are similar between wild type and Rp+/− wing discs. B) 18S rRNA 
level in indicated genotypes in comparison to wild type. Geometric means from 4-6 
biological replicates are shown. Error bars represent ± 1 S.E.M. of the log-transformed data. 
No significant differences are observed among the genotypes (1-way ANOVA, p=0.6824), 
although there is a trend for 18S levels to be somewhat reduced in all the Rp+/− genotypes. 
In addition, in no case were genotypes with and without the Xrp1 mutation significantly 
different (p>0.05 for paired t-tests in all cases). C) Analysis of 5.8S rRNA performed as in 
panel B. 5-6 biological replicates are shown. The null hypothesis that 5.8S levels are the 
same in all samples is rejected (1-way ANOVA, p=0.000011). Pairwise comparison of 
mutant genotypes to wild type control indicates significant differences only between wild 
type and RpL27A/+ (Bonferroni-Holm method, p<0.01) and between wild type and 
RpL27A/+ Xrp1/+ (p<0.05). In addition, in no case were genotypes with and without the 
Xrp1 mutation significantly different (p>0.05 for paired t-tests in all cases). Supplemental 
data related to this Figure is shown in Tables S1-S3.

Figure 6. Xrp1 regulates many genes and is induced by RpS12
A) mRNA was isolated from third instar wing discs enabling comparisons between four 
genotypes. B) Transcript levels of 253 genes were altered in both RpS17++/− and RpS3++/− 
and 206 of these changes were regulated by Xrp1. C) 4 GO terms for Biological Process 
were significantly enriched in the Rp+/− -regulated genes (ie P<0.05 after Benjamini 
correction). D) Expression levels (fold changes relative to wild type control according to 
Deseq2) for Xrp1, RpS17, RpS3 and for the 9 Rp+/−-regulated genes with telomere 
maintenance and DNA recombination GO terms, all of which were regulated by Xrp1. E) 
Expression levels (fold changes relative to wild type control according to Deseq2) for the 13 
Rp+/−-regulated genes with glutathione metabolic process and iron-sulfur cluster GO terms, 
all of which were regulated by Xrp1. F) RpS17+/− wing imaginal disc almost entirely

RpS17+/− cells. H) RpS17+/− rpS1297D/97D wing imaginal disc almost entirely occupied by 
RpS17+/+ rpS1297D/97D clones (unlabelled cells). I) Xrp1 protein is not elevated in the 
RpS17+/− rpS1297D/97D cells. J) Clonal expression of RpS12 and RFP proteins RpS18+/− 
wing disc. K) Xrp1 protein is elevated by RpS12 over-expression. L) RpS18+/+ clones 
(unlabelled cells) in RpS18+/− wing disc. M) Xrp1-LacZ is elevated in RpS18+/− cells. N) 
RpS18++/+ rpS1297D/97D clones (unlabelled cells) in RpS18+/− rpS1297D/97D wing disc. O) 
Xrp1-LacZ is not strongly elevated in the RpS18+/− rpS1297D/97D cells. Supplemental data 
related to this Figure is shown in Figure S5 and Table S1.

Figure 7. Model
Rp/+ genotypes express a phenotype of reduced translation, slow cellular growth rate, and 
reduced competitiveness in comparison to wild type cells. All of these effects of the Rp+/− 
genotypes depended on the bZip-domain protein Xrp1. The signal to induce Xrp1 
transcription depended on the RpS12 protein, which appeared to signal the existence of a 
ribosomal defect or ribosomal protein imbalance(Kale et al., 2018). Xrp1 was responsible 
for reducing the bulk translation rate in Rp+/− cells, and this must include a reduction in the 
translational activity of mature ribosomes. Reduced translation was likely responsible for the 
slow growth of Rp+/− cells, although Xrp1 might also affect growth independently of 
translation. Xrp1 also controlled the competitiveness of Rp+/− cells in mosaics with wild 
type cells, which provides a possibility for eliminating Rp+/− cells in favor of non-mutant 
replacements. We hypothesize that one or more target genes control competitiveness, either 
in response to Xrp1 itself, or indirectly in response to the changes in translation or growth 
rates. By utilizing cell competition, a decision could be made to eliminate defective cells 
only where better cells were available to replace them.
