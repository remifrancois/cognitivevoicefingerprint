Abstract
Background: Blood biomarkers are highly effective in identifying individuals with
amyloid pathology, but not all patients with amyloid will go on to develop symptomatic
Alzheimer’s disease. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to predict who will experience
future cognitive decline and are most likely to benefit from early intervention. Speech-
derived biomarkers built from acoustic and linguistic features found in speech hold
significant potential as scalable prognostic biomarkers working in complement with
blood biomarkers and other markers of pathology; however, their development has
been hindered by the lack of large, clinically annotated speech datasets needed to train
machine learning models.
Method: SpeechDx is a longitudinal observational study that collects and harmonizes
speech, biomarker, and clinical data from up to 3,000 participants across clinical sites in
the U.S., Australia, and Spain. The SpeechDx study population was selected to capture
data from participants who may experience stable cognition or cognitive decline during
the 3 years of SpeechDx data collection: While participants span the full cognitive
spectrum, including normal cognitive (CN), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the majority of the study
population is enrolled as CN or SCD.
Quarterly, participants remotely complete a brief battery of speech- and language-
eliciting tasks via a custom-built SpeechDx app on a study-provided tablet. Tasks
are designed to elicit semi-constrained and unconstrained speech, including picture
description, story recall, storytelling, and open-ended questions. Concurrently, clinical
sites provide participant high-quality clinical and biomarker data collection, including
longitudinal blood AD biomarkers, MRI, and neuropsychological assessments. Clinical
and biomarker data are paired with individual speech samples, de-identified, and
harmonized across all sites to form the unified SpeechDx Dataset. The Dataset is
hosted at the AD Data Initiative Workbench, and access is managed by the Data Access
Committee.

Result: SpeechDx is currently enrolling participants across clinical sites in the US,
Australia, and Spain, with interim data release to SpeechDx partners starting in 2025.
Full dataset completion is anticipated by the end of 2028.
Conclusion: SpeechDx facilitates the development of prognostic AD speech and
language biomarkers through the creation of a harmonized database of longitudinal
speech, biomarker, and clinical data.
